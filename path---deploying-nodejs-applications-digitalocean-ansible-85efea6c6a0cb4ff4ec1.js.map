Then I wanted to be able to deploy it again later on or make changes to the infrastructure in a more controlled way.</p>\\n<p>I wanted to automate the whole process so I can save some time and spend it on actually writing code.</p>\\n<h2>The problem</h2>\\n<p>Up until recently, bootstrapping of my personal projects looked like this:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>I would create a DigitalOcean droplet</li>\\n<li>I would ssh into it after I have added my SSH key</li>\\n<li>I would put a simple configuration, install dependencies, node.js runtime, etc</li>\\n<li>Clone my project from Git</li>\\n<li>Install nginx and set it as a reverse proxy for the node.js application</li>\\n<li>Run it</li>\\n<li>Leave it there</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Whenever I wanted to release a new version, I would log into the droplet pull the repo and restart the node app. The same procedure would be for every other stack I have been playing around.</p>\\n<h2>My options</h2>\\n<p>So I did my homework upfront and came up with these:</p>\\n<h3>Docker</h3>\\n<p>Using <a href=\\\"https://www.docker.com/\\\">Docker</a>, I was able to describe my stack inside a <a href=\\\"https://docs.docker.com/compose/\\\">single file</a>, put it on the server and run it. The server would still have to be there somehow. I would still have to provision the server or have one server that would host many Docker containers. Also, Docker needs to rebuild on every change of the application.</p>\\n<p>I thought it was far away from what I was looking for.</p>\\n<h3>Terraform</h3>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.terraform.io/\\\">Terraform</a> allows you to describe your stack and use it across all major platforms. It supports AWS, DigitalOcean, etc. The thing I didn't like was that it doesn't support provisioning of the server. You have to put a <a href=\\\"https://puppet.com/\\\">puppet</a> or <a href=\\\"https://www.chef.io/chef/\\\">chef</a> to actually provision the servers, if some, in your infrastructure.</p>\\n<p>I believe that Terraform would be much more suitable in an AWS infrastructure where you don't always need to provision something. Not all your infrastructure is going to be ElasticBeanstalk machines. But it is a great choice just to create and configure the dependent services like Lambda, SNS, SQS, API Gateway.</p>\\n<p>Not for my needs.</p>\\n<h3>Ansible</h3>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.ansible.com/\\\">Ansible</a> is an automation tool for running commands on a remote server. Ansible can do anything that you would do from the command line. It even comes with modules so you can create a DigitalOcean droplet in a <a href=\\\"http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/digital_ocean_module.html\\\">single command</a>.</p>\\n<p>You can actually describe the above procedure in a single file and run it as many times as you like. Ansible will make sure that every time only the needed changes would run. You can run it once and build the application without even an existing DigitalOcean droplet. Alternatively, you can run it with an existing droplet and it will just pull your application and rerun it.</p>\\n<p>Iâ€™m not going to get into detail about how ansible works, my friend <a href=\\\"https://www.stavros.io/posts/example-provisioning-and-deployment-ansible/\\\">Stavros</a> has written a nice post where he explains much more about it. Before that, start <a href=\\\"http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_getting_started.html\\\">from the documentation</a>. It's there after all, isn't it?</p>\\n<p>So, write an Ansible file (playbook in Ansible glossary) with the commands that you would run on the remote server. Use this file every time! That's it.</p>\\n<h2>Solution</h2>\\n<p>I decided to go with Ansible. Ansible documentation isn't that extensive but with a little digging around you can actually find any missing information. It's <a href=\\\"https://github.com/ansible/ansible\\\">open source</a> so you can read the code and see how a module works for yourself. <a href=\\\"https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/lib/ansible/modules/cloud/digital_ocean/digital_ocean.py\\\">Try it</a>, it's not that hard! Also, Github is full of Ansible repositories. A lot of which you can grab from <a href=\\\"https://galaxy.ansible.com/\\\">Ansible Galaxy, Ansible's registry for playbooks</a>. It comes with a package manager as well.</p>\\n<p>So I started hacking around and I ended up with an <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/ansible-nodejs-digitalocean\\\">Ansible playbook</a> that will do all the above. It's configurable so I can just copy paste it on my new project and run it to create the droplet and provision it.</p>\\n<p>It also supports adding a domain that is pointing to the created droplet. Plus it will generate a <a href=\\\"https://letsencrypt.org\\\">Let's Encrypt</a> certificate for the specified domain.</p>\\n<p>So you will:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Get a domain name and point it to DigitalOcean's nameservers. Remember to wait for the propagation to happen.</li>\\n<li>Run this playbook once and... Boom! You're ready to go!</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The playbook requires a bit knowledge of Ansible to hack the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/ansible-nodejs-digitalocean/blob/master/tasks/project.yml\\\">tasks/project.yml</a> and set it to your specific needs. Yeah, I had the exact same reaction! Don't be alarmed! It's easier that you think!</p>\\n<h2>Getting started</h2>\\n<p>I will include a quick getting started kind of block here.

It was a great experience, met a lof of new people there. <em>Photos soon to come</em></p>\\n<p>2016 was also hiding a few other surprises. I left Goodvidio a month ago and now I am in the process of getting a new job. It has been 18 amazing months, full startup mode! Met some brilliant and wonderful guys over there. I am going to miss them for sure.</p>\\n<h1>Where to go next</h1>\\n<p>So, what's on for 2017? Well, I won't include the travel/read/speak/write thing! I want those to be parts of my life but I don't want to keep track of them. I will try this year too and even harder.</p>\\n<p>I will try to put a single goal for this year. I have been amazed by Universal Javascript trend that hit the since last year. I think 2017 will be a great year for Isomorphic applications along with progressive apps guidelines. I want this year to get my hands into and build myself an app that will follow all those principles.</p>\\n<p>That's my goal for 2017!</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/Bariotis/Dev/develop/kostasbariotis.com/src/pages/and-another-end/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"timeToRead\":2,\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"2016-12-25T00:00:00.000Z\",\"path\":\"/drafts/and-another-end/\",\"tags\":null,\"title\":\"And another end\",\"draft\":true}},\"next\":{\"excerpt\":\"Knowing how to communicate effectively\\nvalid arguments\\npoints\\nknow what your talkign about\\ndo your homework/research\\nwant to go deeper? fallacies  http://www.nobeliefs.com/fallacies.htm Not everything is about you.
