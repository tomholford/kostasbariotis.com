This is how I did it.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://devastation.tv\\\">devastation.tv</a>, my podcast for developers (for the time in Greek only) is hosted on <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/devastation-podcast\\\">GitHub Pages</a> with a custom domain that I have purchased from <a href=\\\"https://namecheap.com\\\">Namecheap</a>. I wanted to be able to send email campaigns to my subscribers whenever a new episode is out.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://mailchimp.com\\\">Mailchimp</a> helped me a lot on my first campaigns but I would send those emails using my personal Gmail account, which is both ugly for the subscriber to see and is <a href=\\\"http://kb.mailchimp.com/accounts/email-authentication/about-dmarc?_ga=1.191860521.246269979.1477844435\\\">also dangerous</a> cause it may end up in my subscriber's Spam folder.</p>\\n<p>Last but not least, I knew my subscriber list would take a long time until it go big and I didn't want to pay for a paid subscription, e.g. to Gmail for Work (£3.30 per user per month). I had to find a cheaper way, and Mailchimp has a great starter package with up to 2,000 subscribers and 12,000 emails per month.</p>\\n<p>So here's a simple solution that involves having your site hosted on GitHub Pages, using Mailchimp for sending email campaigns and Namecheap as your domain registrar.</p>\\n<h2>Receiving emails</h2>\\n<p>For receiving emails, Namecheap has this great <a href=\\\"https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/308/76/how-can-i-set-up-free-email-forwarding-for-my-domain\\\">email forwarding feature</a> that allows you to forward an incoming email to your domain in an external email. So I put my personal Gmail email there and I am able to receive emails.</p>\\n<p>\\n          <a\\n            class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n            href=\\\"undefined\\\"\\n            style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n            target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n            rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n          >\\n            <span\\n              class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n              style=\\\"position: relative; z-index: -1; display: block; \\\"\\n            >\\n              <span\\n                class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n                style=\\\"padding-bottom: 22.45989304812834%;position: relative; width: 100%; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAECAYAAACOXx+WAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAAaUlEQVQY032OWQqAMAwFvf8pFdT+CO7NUu0zCIJCbGBISGBeqrbrUdcNRAQ5Z4QQwMz37EFExXsFpyQl6HG4kAVvJo3W3/stRoiqL+R5QpxG0LqClwG8z78Bb5LhCtU+lAeV4scf4XniAsiPOq9tajTMAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n              >\\n                <img\\n                  class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n                  style=\\\"width: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n                  alt=\\\"Hello\\\"\\n                  title=\\\"\\\"\\n                  src=\\\"/static/ac29928edd2828fa9fbc8c52fda0d42c-cd462.png\\\"\\n                  srcset=\\\"/static/ac29928edd2828fa9fbc8c52fda0d42c-92f91.png 188w,\\n/static/ac29928edd2828fa9fbc8c52fda0d42c-dc30f.png 375w,\\n/static/ac29928edd2828fa9fbc8c52fda0d42c-cd462.png 750w,\\n/static/ac29928edd2828fa9fbc8c52fda0d42c-4812a.png 1122w\\\"\\n                  sizes=\\\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\\\"\\n                />\\n              </span>\\n            </span>\\n          </a>\\n          </p>\\n<h2>Sending emails</h2>\\n<p>Now Mailchimp allows you to <a href=\\\"http://kb.mailchimp.com/accounts/email-authentication/set-up-custom-domain-authentication-dkim-and-spf\\\">add a custom domain</a> to be able to send emails that originated from that domain.

This is how I did it.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://devastation.tv\\\">devastation.tv</a>, my podcast for developers (for the time in Greek only) is hosted on <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/devastation-podcast\\\">GitHub Pages</a> with a custom domain that I have purchased from <a href=\\\"https://namecheap.com\\\">Namecheap</a>. I wanted to be able to send email campaigns to my subscribers whenever a new episode is out.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://mailchimp.com\\\">Mailchimp</a> helped me a lot on my first campaigns but I would send those emails using my personal Gmail account, which is both ugly for the subscriber to see and is <a href=\\\"http://kb.mailchimp.com/accounts/email-authentication/about-dmarc?_ga=1.191860521.246269979.1477844435\\\">also dangerous</a> cause it may end up in my subscriber's Spam folder.</p>\\n<p>Last but not least, I knew my subscriber list would take a long time until it go big and I didn't want to pay for a paid subscription, e.g. to Gmail for Work (£3.30 per user per month). I had to find a cheaper way, and Mailchimp has a great starter package with up to 2,000 subscribers and 12,000 emails per month.</p>\\n<p>So here's a simple solution that involves having your site hosted on GitHub Pages, using Mailchimp for sending email campaigns and Namecheap as your domain registrar.</p>\\n<h2>Receiving emails</h2>\\n<p>For receiving emails, Namecheap has this great <a href=\\\"https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/308/76/how-can-i-set-up-free-email-forwarding-for-my-domain\\\">email forwarding feature</a> that allows you to forward an incoming email to your domain in an external email. So I put my personal Gmail email there and I am able to receive emails.</p>\\n<p>\\n          <a\\n            class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n            href=\\\"undefined\\\"\\n            style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n            target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n            rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n          >\\n            <span\\n              class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n              style=\\\"position: relative; z-index: -1; display: block; \\\"\\n            >\\n              <span\\n                class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n                style=\\\"padding-bottom: 22.45989304812834%;position: relative; width: 100%; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAECAYAAACOXx+WAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAAaUlEQVQY032OWQqAMAwFvf8pFdT+CO7NUu0zCIJCbGBISGBeqrbrUdcNRAQ5Z4QQwMz37EFExXsFpyQl6HG4kAVvJo3W3/stRoiqL+R5QpxG0LqClwG8z78Bb5LhCtU+lAeV4scf4XniAsiPOq9tajTMAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n              >\\n                <img\\n                  class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n                  style=\\\"width: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n                  alt=\\\"Hello\\\"\\n                  title=\\\"\\\"\\n                  src=\\\"/static/ac29928edd2828fa9fbc8c52fda0d42c-cd462.png\\\"\\n                  srcset=\\\"/static/ac29928edd2828fa9fbc8c52fda0d42c-92f91.png 188w,\\n/static/ac29928edd2828fa9fbc8c52fda0d42c-dc30f.png 375w,\\n/static/ac29928edd2828fa9fbc8c52fda0d42c-cd462.png 750w,\\n/static/ac29928edd2828fa9fbc8c52fda0d42c-4812a.png 1122w\\\"\\n                  sizes=\\\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\\\"\\n                />\\n              </span>\\n            </span>\\n          </a>\\n          </p>\\n<h2>Sending emails</h2>\\n<p>Now Mailchimp allows you to <a href=\\\"http://kb.mailchimp.com/accounts/email-authentication/set-up-custom-domain-authentication-dkim-and-spf\\\">add a custom domain</a> to be able to send emails that originated from that domain.
