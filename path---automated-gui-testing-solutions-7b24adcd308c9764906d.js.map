I explained the concept of TDD and described my tools of choice for integrating the TDD flow with Node.js. It was great.</p>\\n<p>I didn't got into GUI testing and I saw a major interest on that.

I find it a great tool for testing basic functionality in small apps.</p>\\n<p>JSDom will create an in memory representation of the DOM and execute any Javascript dependencies so you can do a real testing scenario. Since it doesn't uses a real browser engine you can't find abnormalities of real world situations. So you can't rely on it for cross browser compatibility.</p>\\n<p>I got very frustrated while trying to test AJAX powered pages. For SPA apps, Zombie wouldn't be an ideal solution.</p>\\n<h2>Casper.js</h2>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://casperjs.org/\\\">Casper</a> on the other hand, is a wrapper around <a href=\\\"http://phantomjs.org/\\\">Phantom.js</a> which utilises a <a href=\\\"https://webkit.org/\\\">Webkit</a> headless browser and will do a full rendering of your web page in order to test it. Since you will have a full representation of your site you can even <a href=\\\"https://github.com/sindresorhus/pageres\\\">take screenshots for easier QA</a>.</p>\\n<p>Casper.js has neat documentation and it's API is really easy to follow and adopt.</p>\\n<h2>Nightwatch.js</h2>\\n<p>Now, on the heavy side, we have <a href=\\\"http://www.seleniumhq.org/\\\">Selenium</a>. Selenium is a set of projects. It started off by auto running browsers and injecting code into them so we can test it. Since then, browsers vendors kept evolving and expose a full set of control over their browsers so Selenium has native support over those, with the <a href=\\\"http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/\\\">Selenium WebDriver</a>.</p>\\n<p>You will have to install all the browsers you need to test locally and then use Selenium to run tests on them. It's pretty basic.</p>\\n<p>Selenium's internals and configuration is a bit overcomplicated and if you don't need it, you don't have to get into it. <a href=\\\"http://nightwatchjs.org/\\\">Nightwatch</a> is a great layer of abstraction on top of Selenium that will do all the heavy work for you.</p>\\n<h1>At the end</h1>\\n<p>I am sure there are tone of other solutions out there.
