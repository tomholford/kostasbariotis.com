You want your errors to be identical everywhere, to provide not too much information for your internal system but enough information to the debugger.</p>\\n<p>I am a REST fan and I hope you are too. What basically REST tell us, is to use <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes\\\">HTTP's error codes</a> for our API responses. E.g. when the user requests a particular row from our DB, using an identifier, and that row doesn't exists we should respond with a <code>404 Not Found</code> status code.</p>\\n<p>Express.js has a <a href=\\\"http://expressjs.com/guide/error-handling.html\\\">default error handler</a>. Basicaly it's just a middleware, with an extra argument, the <code>err</code> argument.</p>\\n<p>On an Express.js request lifecycle, when an error occurs, we pass on to the next middleware with populated error variable, and the error handler triggers.</p>\\n<p>Let's start with that.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code>router<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">use</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>err<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> req<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> res<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> next<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n\\t<span class=\\\"token comment\\\" spellcheck=\\\"true\\\">/* We log the error internaly */</span>\\n    logger<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">error</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>err<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\n\\t<span class=\\\"token comment\\\" spellcheck=\\\"true\\\">/*\\n     * Remove Error's `stack` property.

Logging the error and proper displaying it. So I am logging it using a <a href=\\\"https://github.com/winstonjs/winston\\\">logger</a> module and passing it to the user, using the error's status code. I have predefined those status codes so I don't have to deal with them every time. How? Let's see.</p>\\n<p>An error often consists of more than just an error code. We need a title, little more information and the stack trace on development environment. Instead of dealing with those information every time we create objects and only changing the bits we want each time. Here's a <code>Not Found</code> error object.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code>module<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>exports <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">notFound</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>message<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> errorCode<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n\\n  Error<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">captureStackTrace</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>constructor<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>name <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>constructor<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>name<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>message <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> message <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">||</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'The requested resource couldn\\\\'t be found'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>statusCode <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">404</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>errorCode <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> errorCode <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">||</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">404</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>We are inheriting the Node.js <code>Error</code> class and create a generic <code>Not Found</code> error object we can use every time we need one.</p>\\n<p>So now we need to pass this to the Express.js error handler. So on an ordinary controller we do:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code>app<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">use</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">'/customers/:id'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>req<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> res<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> next<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n\\n\\t<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">var</span> id <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">properSanitization</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>req<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>params<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>id<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\n\\tsomeDBDriver<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">findOne</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>id<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>model<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    \\t<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">if</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">!</span>model<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n        \\t<span class=\\\"token function\\\">next</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">new</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\">NotFound</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">'Entity with id: '</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">+</span> id <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">+</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">' couldn\\\\'t be bound.'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">else</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n        \\t<span class=\\\"token comment\\\" spellcheck=\\\"true\\\">/* ... */</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>So now the error handler will take place and do it's magic.</p>\\n<p>Often, in a more complex API will need more expressive status codes to express it's disfunctionalities. In that case, you can still respond with the proper status code but keep an internal error eode that makes sense on your application. So, in case a user tries to login with wrong credentials, send a 401 to the API consumer but keep an internal code, e.g. 4001 that means <strong>\\\"Wrong Username/Password\\\"</strong>. And that's what the <code>errorCode</code> is.</p>\\n<p>Here's a simple <a href=\\\"http://github.com/kbariotis/throw.js\\\">error collection</a> i've wrote, to save you the hassle.

It was this video, <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVZ-P-ZI6W4\\\">about react-native</a> and how you can build native iOS apps  with Javascript, that really got me thinking.</p>\\n<p>So, I started searching around, reading the <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html\\\">docs</a>, reading what others <a href=\\\"http://blog.reverberate.org/2014/02/react-demystified.html\\\">think</a> <a href=\\\"http://blog.andrewray.me/reactjs-for-stupid-people/\\\">of it</a> and playing with this <a href=\\\"https://github.com/RickWong/react-isomorphic-starterkit\\\">amazing piece of code</a>. But before you go too deep, let me straighten out some facts for you.</p>\\n<h2>What React isn't</h2>\\n<p>React is not a complete framework, kit or anything else. From the homepage:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>A JAVASCRIPT LIBRARY FOR BUILDING USER INTERFACES</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>You won't be able to use it on it's own. React is a library. People refer to it as the <a href=\\\"http://blog.codinghorror.com/understanding-model-view-controller/\\\"><strong>V</strong></a> from the <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller\\\"><strong>MVC</strong></a>. But even as is, it does a hell of amazing job. Here's why.</p>\\n<h2>React Components</h2>\\n<p>React consists of components. You may have already heard about <a href=\\\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components\\\">Web Components</a> that  allow us to create custom HTML tags and include them anywhere on the outside world as easile as we include an <code>H1</code> tag. React components work just like this but can only be used inside the React ecosystem.</p>\\n<p>Furthermore, Facebook implemented a <a href=\\\"http://facebook.github.io/jsx/\\\">new syntax language</a> based on XML in order to compile their new XML based Components into vanilla Javascript. By doing this, we are able to write HTML inside Javascript and not being worry about it.</p>\\n<p>What? Did I just say HTML inside Javascript? Isn't that against the whole MVC movement? Well sort of... But React's team thinks this wa,y we will be able to maintain our code more easily since it exists on fewer files. Newcomers will get their hands on our code more quickly.The new language JSX looks like this:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code>React<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">render</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>\\n\\t<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&lt;</span>h1<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">></span>Hello<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> world<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">!</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&lt;</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">/</span>h1<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n    document<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">getElementById</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">'example'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Lets talk a little bit more about the components. A component is basically a Javascript class that only knows how to render itself. A component can also contain child components it communicates with. This can help us write more modular code.</p>\\n<p>Think of a <code>List</code> element. We will write a List component that will contain a <code>ListItem</code> component. Every time we need to display it, the <code>List</code> component will render a <code>&#x3C;ul/></code> tag with a bunch of <code>ListItem</code> components,, and each of these <code>ListItem</code>s will render <code>&#x3C;li/></code>, each with their information.</p>\\n<p>But wait? Did you said... render... every time? Like every time someone adds something in the list we will rerender it?</p>\\n<h2>Reconciliation</h2>\\n<p>Enter the <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reconciliation.html\\\">Virtual DOM magic, or in React's terms, the Reconciliation</a>. The essence of React. React will not render directly to the DOM every time something changes. Instead, it will render to its own internal DOM (the Virtual DOM) and then  compute diffs on the real DOM. React makes only the appropriate changes to the DOM to reflect the new changes. We never have to interact with the DOM again. We may never even have to write external stylesheets. React <a href=\\\"http://facebook.github.io/react/tips/inline-styles.html\\\">has you covered</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n<p>I would suggest getting your hands on the React's documentation as fast as possible. There are a lot of concepts you need to understand in order to grasp its full potential.</p>\\n<p>As I said, in the beginning, it was <a href=\\\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native\\\">react-native</a> that forced me to play with React. But there are a <a href=\\\"http://blog.risingstack.com/from-angularjs-to-react-the-isomorphic-way/\\\">lot</a> <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/flux/\\\">more</a> goodies to explore and I haven't play with all of them yet.\\nUntil next time, take care!</p>\\n<p><em>Please let me know if I missed or misunderstood something, since it's my second day using React. If you liked my article please share it. :)</em></p>\\n<p><em>I have to thank <a href=\\\"http://mplewis.com/\\\">Matthew Lewis</a> for reviewing this article.

You want your errors to be identical everywhere, to provide not too much information for your internal system but enough information to the debugger.</p>\\n<p>I am a REST fan and I hope you are too. What basically REST tell us, is to use <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes\\\">HTTP's error codes</a> for our API responses. E.g. when the user requests a particular row from our DB, using an identifier, and that row doesn't exists we should respond with a <code>404 Not Found</code> status code.</p>\\n<p>Express.js has a <a href=\\\"http://expressjs.com/guide/error-handling.html\\\">default error handler</a>. Basicaly it's just a middleware, with an extra argument, the <code>err</code> argument.</p>\\n<p>On an Express.js request lifecycle, when an error occurs, we pass on to the next middleware with populated error variable, and the error handler triggers.</p>\\n<p>Let's start with that.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code>router<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">use</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>err<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> req<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> res<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> next<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n\\t<span class=\\\"token comment\\\" spellcheck=\\\"true\\\">/* We log the error internaly */</span>\\n    logger<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">error</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>err<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\n\\t<span class=\\\"token comment\\\" spellcheck=\\\"true\\\">/*\\n     * Remove Error's `stack` property.

Logging the error and proper displaying it. So I am logging it using a <a href=\\\"https://github.com/winstonjs/winston\\\">logger</a> module and passing it to the user, using the error's status code. I have predefined those status codes so I don't have to deal with them every time. How? Let's see.</p>\\n<p>An error often consists of more than just an error code. We need a title, little more information and the stack trace on development environment. Instead of dealing with those information every time we create objects and only changing the bits we want each time. Here's a <code>Not Found</code> error object.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code>module<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>exports <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">notFound</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>message<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> errorCode<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n\\n  Error<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">captureStackTrace</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>constructor<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>name <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>constructor<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>name<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>message <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> message <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">||</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'The requested resource couldn\\\\'t be found'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>statusCode <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">404</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>errorCode <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> errorCode <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">||</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">404</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>We are inheriting the Node.js <code>Error</code> class and create a generic <code>Not Found</code> error object we can use every time we need one.</p>\\n<p>So now we need to pass this to the Express.js error handler. So on an ordinary controller we do:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code>app<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">use</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">'/customers/:id'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>req<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> res<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> next<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n\\n\\t<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">var</span> id <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">properSanitization</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>req<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>params<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>id<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\n\\tsomeDBDriver<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">findOne</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>id<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>model<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    \\t<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">if</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">!</span>model<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n        \\t<span class=\\\"token function\\\">next</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">new</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\">NotFound</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">'Entity with id: '</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">+</span> id <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">+</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">' couldn\\\\'t be bound.'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">else</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n        \\t<span class=\\\"token comment\\\" spellcheck=\\\"true\\\">/* ... */</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>So now the error handler will take place and do it's magic.</p>\\n<p>Often, in a more complex API will need more expressive status codes to express it's disfunctionalities. In that case, you can still respond with the proper status code but keep an internal error eode that makes sense on your application. So, in case a user tries to login with wrong credentials, send a 401 to the API consumer but keep an internal code, e.g. 4001 that means <strong>\\\"Wrong Username/Password\\\"</strong>. And that's what the <code>errorCode</code> is.</p>\\n<p>Here's a simple <a href=\\\"http://github.com/kbariotis/throw.js\\\">error collection</a> i've wrote, to save you the hassle.

It was this video, <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVZ-P-ZI6W4\\\">about react-native</a> and how you can build native iOS apps  with Javascript, that really got me thinking.</p>\\n<p>So, I started searching around, reading the <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html\\\">docs</a>, reading what others <a href=\\\"http://blog.reverberate.org/2014/02/react-demystified.html\\\">think</a> <a href=\\\"http://blog.andrewray.me/reactjs-for-stupid-people/\\\">of it</a> and playing with this <a href=\\\"https://github.com/RickWong/react-isomorphic-starterkit\\\">amazing piece of code</a>. But before you go too deep, let me straighten out some facts for you.</p>\\n<h2>What React isn't</h2>\\n<p>React is not a complete framework, kit or anything else. From the homepage:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>A JAVASCRIPT LIBRARY FOR BUILDING USER INTERFACES</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>You won't be able to use it on it's own. React is a library. People refer to it as the <a href=\\\"http://blog.codinghorror.com/understanding-model-view-controller/\\\"><strong>V</strong></a> from the <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller\\\"><strong>MVC</strong></a>. But even as is, it does a hell of amazing job. Here's why.</p>\\n<h2>React Components</h2>\\n<p>React consists of components. You may have already heard about <a href=\\\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components\\\">Web Components</a> that  allow us to create custom HTML tags and include them anywhere on the outside world as easile as we include an <code>H1</code> tag. React components work just like this but can only be used inside the React ecosystem.</p>\\n<p>Furthermore, Facebook implemented a <a href=\\\"http://facebook.github.io/jsx/\\\">new syntax language</a> based on XML in order to compile their new XML based Components into vanilla Javascript. By doing this, we are able to write HTML inside Javascript and not being worry about it.</p>\\n<p>What? Did I just say HTML inside Javascript? Isn't that against the whole MVC movement? Well sort of... But React's team thinks this wa,y we will be able to maintain our code more easily since it exists on fewer files. Newcomers will get their hands on our code more quickly.The new language JSX looks like this:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code>React<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">render</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>\\n\\t<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&lt;</span>h1<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">></span>Hello<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> world<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">!</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&lt;</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">/</span>h1<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n    document<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">getElementById</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">'example'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Lets talk a little bit more about the components. A component is basically a Javascript class that only knows how to render itself. A component can also contain child components it communicates with. This can help us write more modular code.</p>\\n<p>Think of a <code>List</code> element. We will write a List component that will contain a <code>ListItem</code> component. Every time we need to display it, the <code>List</code> component will render a <code>&#x3C;ul/></code> tag with a bunch of <code>ListItem</code> components,, and each of these <code>ListItem</code>s will render <code>&#x3C;li/></code>, each with their information.</p>\\n<p>But wait? Did you said... render... every time? Like every time someone adds something in the list we will rerender it?</p>\\n<h2>Reconciliation</h2>\\n<p>Enter the <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reconciliation.html\\\">Virtual DOM magic, or in React's terms, the Reconciliation</a>. The essence of React. React will not render directly to the DOM every time something changes. Instead, it will render to its own internal DOM (the Virtual DOM) and then  compute diffs on the real DOM. React makes only the appropriate changes to the DOM to reflect the new changes. We never have to interact with the DOM again. We may never even have to write external stylesheets. React <a href=\\\"http://facebook.github.io/react/tips/inline-styles.html\\\">has you covered</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n<p>I would suggest getting your hands on the React's documentation as fast as possible. There are a lot of concepts you need to understand in order to grasp its full potential.</p>\\n<p>As I said, in the beginning, it was <a href=\\\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native\\\">react-native</a> that forced me to play with React. But there are a <a href=\\\"http://blog.risingstack.com/from-angularjs-to-react-the-isomorphic-way/\\\">lot</a> <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/flux/\\\">more</a> goodies to explore and I haven't play with all of them yet.\\nUntil next time, take care!</p>\\n<p><em>Please let me know if I missed or misunderstood something, since it's my second day using React.
