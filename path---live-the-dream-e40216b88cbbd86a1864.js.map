Both of those forms are usually required in a long-running project.</p>\\n<h3>Altering schema</h3>\\n<p>One of them is when we are in need of changing the database's schema. For example, when we add an Index, removing/adding a field or restructuring the current fields, moving one from being a String into an Integer.\\nThis could also mean that we may need to restructure the data that is already in the database, which brings us to the second form of migrations.</p>\\n<h3>Migrating data</h3>\\n<p>In a production environment, where data is already in the DB, we may have to migrate those as well. Same cases apply to testing and staging environments but production is a more fragile universe where mistakes are not forgiven.  Say we need to split the <code>Name</code> field of our Users table into a <code>First/Last Name</code> fields combination. One approach would be to create a field called <code>Last Name</code>. Traverse the table, split the <code>Name</code> into two chunks and move the latter to the newly created field. Finally, rename the <code>Name</code> field into <code>First Name</code>. This is a case of data migrations.</p>\\n<p>But how do we handle this without putting our hands in the DB?</p>\\n<h2>Automation is the key</h2>\\n<p>We must be able to describe our database and the migrations with code. This will allow us to store them into our VCS and run them on demand and in an autonomous way.</p>\\n<h2>SQL vs NoSQL</h2>\\n<p>As we know, SQL and NoSQL have some core differences but that also doesn't mean that we can omit migrations in any of them. SQL structure is strictly defined and both data and schema changes can be safely done using migrations. NoSQL, on the other hand, may not need that much of a schema change, due to their elasticity in that subject, but will definitely need data migrations.</p>\\n<h2>Database?</h2>\\n<p>Modern apps don't necessarily handle data or talk to a database directly. E.g., in a Microservices environment, applications may rely on other applications to hold their data and communicate with them through a REST API. That's ok because migrations may still need to run. But instead of interacting directly with a database, you have to use the API to make your changes.</p>\\n<h2>Migrations dive with Nodejs</h2>\\n<p>Applications built with Nodejs have no differences from any other stack.</p>\\n<p>After doing a little research, I ended up using <a href=\\\"https://github.com/sequelize/umzug\\\">umzug</a> which provides a nice programmatic API to make your migrations. It's not opinionated at all and it doesn't provide any helper functions to make your actual migrations. It's just a library that will store what migrations have run. Which is actually what I need. If you need a more powerful thing you may want to take a look at <a href=\\\"https://github.com/db-migrate/node-db-migrate\\\">db-migrate</a>, which provides adapters for major databases and it will help you make changes to those in a more intuitive way.</p>\\n<p>Migration systems are providing a few standard things in order to make your migrations. Let's see those using Node.js:</p>\\n<h3>Write a migration</h3>\\n<p>Usually, we want to define two standard methods for a migration script. The function to run when we are migrating and the function when we are rolling back:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token string\\\">'use strict'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">var</span> Promise <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">require</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">'bluebird'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\nmodule<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>exports <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  up<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">new</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\">Promise</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>resolve<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> reject<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token comment\\\" spellcheck=\\\"true\\\">/* Here we write our migration function */</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n\\n  down<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">new</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\">Promise</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>resolve<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> reject<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token comment\\\" spellcheck=\\\"true\\\">/* This runs if we decide to rollback.

For that matter, we should choose our naming strategy wisely before implementation. I have chosen to give them a separate versioning, e.g. 1.0.js, 1.1.js or we could give them the issue ID of our PM that refers to the particular requirement. The choice is yours. Just be consistent.</p>\\n<h3>Keep track of the migrations that have already been executed</h3>\\n<p>At any given moment, we must be able to tell what migrations have been executed and which migration needs to run next if there is one to run.\\nThis allows us to know the state of our database.</p>\\n<p>Umzug can use Sequelize to store the history of the migration into MySQL. <a href=\\\"https://github.com/sequelize/umzug#custom\\\">But with no hassle at all, we can write our own Adaptor to store them wherever we want</a>.</p>\\n<h3>Run a migration or run all migrations</h3>\\n<p>We have to be able to run a specific migration or run all migrations we have written. Those must run in order because usually some of them depend on others.\\nE.g. on a fresh environment we must run all migrations in order to bring the newly created database to its current state, as it currently lies in production.</p>\\n<p>To run all migrations:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code>umzug<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">up</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">then</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">...</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>or to run up to a particular migration:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code>umzug<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">up</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span> to<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'migration-filename'</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">then</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">...</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h3>Rollback a migration</h3>\\n<p>When defining one particular migration we are describing changes that will be applied to the database. Those changes must be reversible and that is why we must also describe the reverse action of that migration.\\nIn case we need to rollback our application back in a previous state that also introduced database changes, those changes must be revert as well in order for the application to continue operating like it used to do.</p>\\n<p>Just like <code>up</code>, but running <code>down</code> instead:\\nTo revert all migrations:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code>umzug<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">down</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">then</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">...</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>or to revert down to a particular migration:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code>umzug<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">down</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span> to<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'migration-filename'</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">then</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">...</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h3>Automating</h3>\\n<p>umzug doesn't come with a CLI out of the box, but it doesn't take much to write one yourself.\\nAfter I wrote mine, it's just a matter of:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-bash\\\"><code>node scripts/migrate\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>to run all migrations in fresh environments.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-bash\\\"><code>node scripts/migrate <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">[</span>up<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">|</span>down<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">]</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>version<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>to go to that particular migration. This will run on every instance of our application at boot time, so if there is a pending migration, it will run it.</p>\\n<h2>In conclusion</h2>\\n<p>Database manipulation should be part of our development process. There could be heavy changes where a developer couldn't handle and a DBA should come, but for rapid changes, migrations will serve us right, especially when we seeking for faster release cycles and keeping track of our Database changes.</p>\\n<p>I am sure that your system handles migration somehow, search it up if you have never thought of it.</p>\\n<p>In case you are already doing migrations, what is your preferred workflow?

There was also a talk there, entitled Testing Demystified, after me. The excellent engineer gave a lot of food for thought about testing. I wasn't aware of most of them.</p>\\n<p>So I decided to write a similar post to let me clear my head on the subject.</p>\\n<h1>Test Driven Development</h1>\\n<p>The most common term you will meet in software is TDD. It's concept is actually simple. We write tests before start coding. <a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-By-Example/dp/0321146530\\\">Kent Beck</a> describes it like this:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Red</li>\\n<li>Green</li>\\n<li>Refactor</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>We first write our tests based on our specifications. We run them and of course they won't succeed thus are going to be red. Then we write the smallest amount of code to make our tests pass and meet our requirements. Once we get the green flag we start refactoring and cleaning our code.</p>\\n<h2>Unit Testing</h2>\\n<p>Unit tests are the start of every test suite. Before starting to unit test, one must define what a unit is, which may vary from team to team. The well known rule is that a unit is the smallest piece of code that can be tested. Regardless of if it's a function, a class or even a whole system in some cases.</p>\\n<p>Unit tests must run fast and run often. To achieve maximum speed,  they are being run in isolation. Thus mocking and stubbing of dependent units happens often. For example, a database can be mocked instead of actually hitting it.</p>\\n<p>I like to have my unit tests independent from the whole test suite. I use a watch process to run them every time I change something in the code. This way I cannot forget to make sure that they are passing, before commit.</p>\\n<h2>Components/Integration Testing</h2>\\n<p>After writing our unit tests, next are Components Tests. Those are used to test units in combination. Units that are working together should be tested by Components Testing.</p>\\n<p>We should mock external services that are not part of the requirement under testing.</p>\\n<h2>End to End/System Testing</h2>\\n<p>Finally, we are testing anythings, from the User Interface to the Database. Testing each intermediate component. To make sure that our system meets business requirements, System Testing happens by the user perspective.</p>\\n<h1>Property Testing</h1>\\n<p>An important concept in testing a system is Property Testing. Instead of taking certain test cases, we are instructing our system to take different values and test against them. This way we can even find cases that we didn't thought. Property testing can be applied at any level of our test suite.</p>\\n<h1>How much to test</h1>\\n<p>A question that usually shows up is \\\"How much should I be testing\\\". While a possible good answer could be \\\"As much as you can\\\" this is often not the case. Testing can't always be a priority. There is a point in the size of every test suite that once we pass it, there is no more the need to test. Unless new requirements are introduced, we are running the suite to be sure that nothing breaks.</p>\\n<p>Before you try to answer the \\\"how much to test\\\", let's take a look into the \\\"what to test\\\". The concept says that to put minimum effort and investment into manual and GUI testing, we should invest into the lower levels. Manual is by default more expensive and more fault tolerant. Bugs are more possible to pass by manual tests than automated unit tests.</p>\\n<p>We can't eliminate manual testing and surely we can't automate it. But we can be sure that having a stronger automated test foundation we leave fewer errors to be found in the upper levels of testing.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/Bariotis/Dev/develop/kostasbariotis.com/src/pages/testing/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"timeToRead\":3,\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"2016-05-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\"path\":\"/drafts/testing/\",\"tags\":null,\"title\":\"Testing Software Systems\",\"draft\":true}}}}\n\n/***/ })\n\n});\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// path---live-the-dream-e40216b88cbbd86a1864.js","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"Kostas Bariotis' Blog\",\"description\":\"I'm Kostas Bariotis, a web developer, a proud wanderer and a passionate doer.

But instead of interacting directly with a database, you have to use the API to make your changes.</p>\\n<h2>Migrations dive with Nodejs</h2>\\n<p>Applications built with Nodejs have no differences from any other stack.</p>\\n<p>After doing a little research, I ended up using <a href=\\\"https://github.com/sequelize/umzug\\\">umzug</a> which provides a nice programmatic API to make your migrations. It's not opinionated at all and it doesn't provide any helper functions to make your actual migrations. It's just a library that will store what migrations have run. Which is actually what I need. If you need a more powerful thing you may want to take a look at <a href=\\\"https://github.com/db-migrate/node-db-migrate\\\">db-migrate</a>, which provides adapters for major databases and it will help you make changes to those in a more intuitive way.</p>\\n<p>Migration systems are providing a few standard things in order to make your migrations. Let's see those using Node.js:</p>\\n<h3>Write a migration</h3>\\n<p>Usually, we want to define two standard methods for a migration script. The function to run when we are migrating and the function when we are rolling back:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token string\\\">'use strict'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">var</span> Promise <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">require</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">'bluebird'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\nmodule<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>exports <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  up<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">new</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\">Promise</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>resolve<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> reject<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token comment\\\" spellcheck=\\\"true\\\">/* Here we write our migration function */</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n\\n  down<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">new</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\">Promise</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>resolve<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> reject<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token comment\\\" spellcheck=\\\"true\\\">/* This runs if we decide to rollback.

For that matter, we should choose our naming strategy wisely before implementation. I have chosen to give them a separate versioning, e.g. 1.0.js, 1.1.js or we could give them the issue ID of our PM that refers to the particular requirement. The choice is yours. Just be consistent.</p>\\n<h3>Keep track of the migrations that have already been executed</h3>\\n<p>At any given moment, we must be able to tell what migrations have been executed and which migration needs to run next if there is one to run.\\nThis allows us to know the state of our database.</p>\\n<p>Umzug can use Sequelize to store the history of the migration into MySQL. <a href=\\\"https://github.com/sequelize/umzug#custom\\\">But with no hassle at all, we can write our own Adaptor to store them wherever we want</a>.</p>\\n<h3>Run a migration or run all migrations</h3>\\n<p>We have to be able to run a specific migration or run all migrations we have written. Those must run in order because usually some of them depend on others.\\nE.g. on a fresh environment we must run all migrations in order to bring the newly created database to its current state, as it currently lies in production.</p>\\n<p>To run all migrations:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code>umzug<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">up</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">then</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">...</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>or to run up to a particular migration:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code>umzug<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">up</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span> to<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'migration-filename'</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">then</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">...</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h3>Rollback a migration</h3>\\n<p>When defining one particular migration we are describing changes that will be applied to the database. Those changes must be reversible and that is why we must also describe the reverse action of that migration.\\nIn case we need to rollback our application back in a previous state that also introduced database changes, those changes must be revert as well in order for the application to continue operating like it used to do.</p>\\n<p>Just like <code>up</code>, but running <code>down</code> instead:\\nTo revert all migrations:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code>umzug<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">down</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">then</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">...</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>or to revert down to a particular migration:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code>umzug<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">down</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span> to<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'migration-filename'</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">then</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">...</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h3>Automating</h3>\\n<p>umzug doesn't come with a CLI out of the box, but it doesn't take much to write one yourself.\\nAfter I wrote mine, it's just a matter of:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-bash\\\"><code>node scripts/migrate\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>to run all migrations in fresh environments.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-bash\\\"><code>node scripts/migrate <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">[</span>up<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">|</span>down<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">]</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>version<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>to go to that particular migration. This will run on every instance of our application at boot time, so if there is a pending migration, it will run it.</p>\\n<h2>In conclusion</h2>\\n<p>Database manipulation should be part of our development process. There could be heavy changes where a developer couldn't handle and a DBA should come, but for rapid changes, migrations will serve us right, especially when we seeking for faster release cycles and keeping track of our Database changes.</p>\\n<p>I am sure that your system handles migration somehow, search it up if you have never thought of it.</p>\\n<p>In case you are already doing migrations, what is your preferred workflow?

There was also a talk there, entitled Testing Demystified, after me. The excellent engineer gave a lot of food for thought about testing. I wasn't aware of most of them.</p>\\n<p>So I decided to write a similar post to let me clear my head on the subject.</p>\\n<h1>Test Driven Development</h1>\\n<p>The most common term you will meet in software is TDD. It's concept is actually simple. We write tests before start coding. <a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-By-Example/dp/0321146530\\\">Kent Beck</a> describes it like this:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Red</li>\\n<li>Green</li>\\n<li>Refactor</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>We first write our tests based on our specifications. We run them and of course they won't succeed thus are going to be red. Then we write the smallest amount of code to make our tests pass and meet our requirements. Once we get the green flag we start refactoring and cleaning our code.</p>\\n<h2>Unit Testing</h2>\\n<p>Unit tests are the start of every test suite. Before starting to unit test, one must define what a unit is, which may vary from team to team. The well known rule is that a unit is the smallest piece of code that can be tested. Regardless of if it's a function, a class or even a whole system in some cases.</p>\\n<p>Unit tests must run fast and run often. To achieve maximum speed,  they are being run in isolation. Thus mocking and stubbing of dependent units happens often. For example, a database can be mocked instead of actually hitting it.</p>\\n<p>I like to have my unit tests independent from the whole test suite. I use a watch process to run them every time I change something in the code. This way I cannot forget to make sure that they are passing, before commit.</p>\\n<h2>Components/Integration Testing</h2>\\n<p>After writing our unit tests, next are Components Tests. Those are used to test units in combination. Units that are working together should be tested by Components Testing.</p>\\n<p>We should mock external services that are not part of the requirement under testing.</p>\\n<h2>End to End/System Testing</h2>\\n<p>Finally, we are testing anythings, from the User Interface to the Database. Testing each intermediate component. To make sure that our system meets business requirements, System Testing happens by the user perspective.</p>\\n<h1>Property Testing</h1>\\n<p>An important concept in testing a system is Property Testing. Instead of taking certain test cases, we are instructing our system to take different values and test against them. This way we can even find cases that we didn't thought. Property testing can be applied at any level of our test suite.</p>\\n<h1>How much to test</h1>\\n<p>A question that usually shows up is \\\"How much should I be testing\\\". While a possible good answer could be \\\"As much as you can\\\" this is often not the case. Testing can't always be a priority. There is a point in the size of every test suite that once we pass it, there is no more the need to test. Unless new requirements are introduced, we are running the suite to be sure that nothing breaks.</p>\\n<p>Before you try to answer the \\\"how much to test\\\", let's take a look into the \\\"what to test\\\". The concept says that to put minimum effort and investment into manual and GUI testing, we should invest into the lower levels. Manual is by default more expensive and more fault tolerant. Bugs are more possible to pass by manual tests than automated unit tests.</p>\\n<p>We can't eliminate manual testing and surely we can't automate it. But we can be sure that having a stronger automated test foundation we leave fewer errors to be found in the upper levels of testing.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/Bariotis/Dev/develop/kostasbariotis.com/src/pages/testing/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"timeToRead\":3,\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"2016-05-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\"path\":\"/drafts/testing/\",\"tags\":null,\"title\":\"Testing Software Systems\",\"draft\":true}}}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/live-the-dream.json\n// module id = ./node_modules/json-loader/index.js!./.cache/json/live-the-dream.json\n// module chunks = 172489398118067"],"sourceRoot":""}
