How to debug and some of the most trivial bugs you will eventually find in your code.</p>\n<p>It goes on with more skills like motivation, evolution, how to stress test, be a team player and communicate effectively with every type of people involved in this industry.</p>\n<p>It is divided in 3 chapters, Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced and every chapter contains a few paragraphs for every concept.</p>\n<p>I was really amazed by this essay and i would surely recommended to every beginner, junior, mid-senior professional programmer. I guess senior would already know these stuffs.</p>\n<p>What are you favorite recent reads?</p>',frontmatter:{date:"October 25, 2014",path:"/how-to-be-a-programmer-by-robert-l-read",tags:"clean code, code, programmers, debugging",title:"How To Be A Programmer by Robert L Read"}}},pathContext:{prev:{excerpt:"Hasn't been a long time when i started working with  Wearetech.io  and my first challenge was on.

We have a use case where an individual would be able to register on our site as a City Curator.</p>\n<p>He could search for his City and if he wouldn’t find it in our database he would register it. When the next candidate comes in, he searches for his place and if it would be inside a 10 kilometers range of an already registered city we would deny it, since we wouldn’t want to have city calendars overlapping with each other.</p>\n<p>When <a title="Thanasis Polychronakis on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/thanpolas" target="_blank">Thanasis </a>started building Wearetech.io he decided to go with MongoDB. So in order to create the above scenario, <a title="MongoDB Geospatial Queries" href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/applications/geospatial-indexes/" target="_blank">MongoDB Geospatial Queries</a> to the rescue!</p>\n<p>MongoDB supports two types of <a title="Geospatial Queries on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_query" target="_blank">Geospatial Queries</a> indexing.</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>The spherical (<a title="2dSphere Indexes on MongoDB" href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/2dsphere/" target="_blank">2dSphere</a>), that would allow you to store shapes made of points (coordinates) and then make comparisons with them like intersection, etc.</li>\n\t<li>The flat (<a title="2d indexes on MongoDB" href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/2d/" target="_blank">2d</a>), that would store single points and then come up with their distances.</li>\n</ul>\nYour choice will affect your development a lot down the road, so think wisely.\n<p>Now on the code side, we will use Mongoose to shape our models. Here\'s the most simple one.</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript">var mongoose     = require(\'mongoose\');\nvar Schema     = mongoose.Schema;\n\nvar CitySchema   = new Schema({\n  name: String,\n  geo: {\n    type: [Number],\n    index: \'2d\'\n  }\n});\n\nmodule.exports = mongoose.model(\'City\', CitySchema);</code></pre>\n<p>Now we can start populating our DB like this</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript">var City = require(\'./app/models/city\');\n\nvar cityModel     = new City(); \ncityModel.name = req.body.name; \ncityModel.geo    = [ req.body.lat, req.body.lng ]; \n\ncityModel.save(function (err) {\n  if (err)\n    res.send(err);\n\n  res.json({});\n});</code></pre>\n<p>And now on the fun part</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript">var distance = 1000 / 6371;\n\nvar query = City.findOne({\'geo\': {\n  $near: [\n    req.body.lat,\n    req.body.lng\n  ],\n  $maxDistance: distance\n\n  }\n});\n\nquery.exec(function (err, city) {\n  if (err) {\n    console.log(err);\n    throw err;\n  }\n\n  if (!city) {\n    res.json({});\n  } else {\n    console.log(\'Cant save: Found city:\' + city);\n    res.json(city);\n }\n\n});</code></pre>\n<p>Our distance is in radians metric system and you can find more on how to calculate it <a title="Convert to radians" href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/calculate-distances-using-spherical-geometry-with-2d-geospatial-indexes/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Due to recent Heroku pricing changes, this demo has broke. Still haven\'t find the time to fix it. :(</em>\nHere is a <a title="MongoDB Geospatial Queries PoC" href="https://damp-everglades-7521.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">demo </a>of it. Try searching your City. If it\'s available register it and then try to find a place inside a 10 kilometers range of your previeus registered City.</p>\n<p>Hope you will find it interesting.

You can write almost any validation rule for any data structure and group it in a single object:v::key("name", v::string()-&gt;length(1, 32)) -&gt;key("birth", v::date(\'Y-m-d\')-&gt;minimumAge(18)) -&gt;assert($someArrayWithData);</li>\n\t<li>You can nest as many validators as you want.</li>\n\t<li>Each validator is an instance that you can reuse (even for composing new, more complex instances).</li>\n\t<li>Three kinds of validation reports (validate() returns true/false, check() stops on first error, assert() collect all errors).</li>\n\t<li>Nested reports implement RecursiveIteratorIterator AND RecursiveTreeIterator (that\'s where the ASCII tree report came from!)</li>\n\t<li>A selector API for finding messages in complex nested reports (findMessages(["user.address.street.length"])).</li>\n\t<li>Reports are only generated when needed (true/false validation doesn\'t even touch the reporting system).</li>\n\t<li>Really easy to extend (most rules have a single method).</li>\n\t<li>Really easy to make inline rules:v::callback(function ($input) { return $input == 42; });</li>\n\t<li>Logic operations on any validator:v::allOf(v::numeric(), v::hexa(), v::min(1)); // numeric, hexadecimal and at least 1 v::oneOf(v::nullValue(), v::numeric()); // null or numeric</li>\n\t<li>Integrates with ZF1, ZF2 and Symfony2 validators if needed. Dependency is optional.</li>\n\t<li>A full concrete API (not relying on magic methods or chains) that can be built using dependency injection.</li>\n\t<li>Straightforward to use on unit tests instead of the PHPUnit assertion library.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\nHere i wrote a simple User Model class where we can make our validation:\n<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/stakisko/dfba7e1b576954232cd5">https://gist.github.com/stakisko/dfba7e1b576954232cd5</a></p>\n<p>Validation will throw an exception when it fail and you can inform your users.</p>',id:"/Users/Bariotis/Dev/develop/gatsby-blog-starter-kit/src/pages/valiation-the-most-awesome-validation-engine-ever-created-for-php/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:2,frontmatter:{date:"2014-10-08T16:02:59.000Z",path:"//valiation-the-most-awesome-validation-engine-ever-created-for-php",tags:"php, validation, oop",title:"Valiation : The most awesome validation engine ever created for PHP",draft:null}}}}}});
