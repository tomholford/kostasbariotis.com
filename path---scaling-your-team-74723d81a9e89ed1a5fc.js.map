Someone created it. This is my list for a happy and efficient development team. Cause these two are tied together and evolving along side.</p>\\n<h3>Coding Style Guide</h3>\\n<p>is the new RFC. Force everyone to <a href=\\\"https://github.com/airbnb/javascript\\\">be in the same page</a>. As in every other social team, so and your team must <a href=\\\"https://github.com/google/styleguide\\\">meet rules</a> and follow them for the common good.</p>\\n<p>Everyone should write the same code.

If you don't keep your code under some kind of version control, there is nothing much left for you.</p>\\n<p>Version controlling your code means that you keep history of every file change, every line addition and deletion. Jumping from the present to a certain point of past, that you know your code was working will save you tone of hours of frustration and money.</p>\\n<h3>Dev Environments</h3>\\n<p>that simulates the live project.

Those tasks should be sorted by criticality - prioritisation should be respected.</p>\\n<h3>Responsibilities</h3>\\n<p>must be clear to everyone. Have you ever been in a situation where the manager asks why something happened and everyone in the team is looking each other? I know, it sucks. But clearly, there weren't no responsibilities. Keeping responsibilities clear means that everyone knows when it's time to stand up and take the response.
