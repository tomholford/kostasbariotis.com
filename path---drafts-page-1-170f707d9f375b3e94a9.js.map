They do one thing and they do it extremely well. I've build a ton of sites using Jekyll hosted either on GitHub either somewhere else. They all work pretty much the same way:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>You describe your content in some common templating language (JADE, Handlebars, etc)</li>\\n<li>While in development, start a local web server and add file \\\"watchers\\\" that will listen for content changes and re-render the site</li>\\n<li>Finally, you render the whole site in static HTML and deploy. The generator will combine your files and produce a well formed HTML content.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>For client side functionality, you have to keep the client side logic separated from the backend. Much like in an architecture where Wordpress is involved. So, pretty much nothing is changing. Literally, the difference from having a cached version of wordpress and content generated with Jekyll is none.</p>\\n<h2>Enter the new world order</h2>\\n<p>React.js! Aw yeah! We've heard about it! It's dominating the Web, but for a reason really. There are really so many reasons React.js have gained such a hype. Many of the techniques we will discuss here can be easily applied with other frameworks and libraries but React.js can play so nicely with them.</p>\\n<p>There is this function called Server Side Rendering where you can produce static HTML content directly from a tree of React.js components. That content will still contains the required React.js specific anotations needed so when the same tree will be loaded on the client, on top of the previously produced content, will know exactly what has to be rendered and what not to. From there, the client side logic can take the lead. Once the user visits a site, the server will directly respond with the static HTML. Once it's loaded in the user's browser and the user navigates in another route, the client side logic will respond and will render the new page, instead of contacting the server again. The same codebase will be used for the backend as also for the frontend. And that's really a game changer.</p>\\n<p>So let's see the new list:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Describe your content in React.js Components</li>\\n<li>On development time, write code like a boss (hot reloading, modularized code, webpack plugins, etc...)</li>\\n<li>Use React.js SSR API to produce the static content to be served on the backend, as well as the frontend side assets to be used on the visitor's browser</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Wait, what? Just like that?</h2>\\n<p>Yeah, I know. I made it look so easy. It's really not. There is the need for a strong abstraction that will track your links across your components, parse content written in another format, like blog posts written in Markdown, generate code that will not bloat the client and will efficiently server the content to the user.</p>\\n<p>Thankfully, there are a few projects that took the initiative and they are doing a great job so far. At the time of reading this, this site will already be served by GitHub pages and the content you will see once you view the source it's been generated by <a href=\\\"https://gatsbyjs.org\\\">Gatsby.js</a>.</p>\\n<p>I have been following those projects for quite a few time now. Here's my list:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://gatsbyjs.org\\\">Gatsby.js</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://phenomic.io\\\">Phenomic</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://nextein.now.sh\\\">nextein</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>At the time that I started following them, all of them were in a very early stage and none of them could generate my site's content the way I wanted and in the same way as my previous one so to not lose paths and certain functionalities. I wanted to make the generated site, exactly like the old one in terms of the user experience. Once Gatsby.js hitted major version 1, I started using it and the result..., you are looking at it!</p>\\n<h2>What exactly am I looking at?</h2>\\n<p>First, if you navigate around my site, you will notice that the browser doesn't fully re-renders the site. Gatsby will generate a JSON file for each route, so the browser can request only that file and React.js will render only the appropriate components. (Previously, I was using a technique called <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com__ghost-theme/blob/master/src/js/app.js#L11\\\">pjax</a> to create the same effect. While it looked the same, it was more hack-ish.)</p>\\n<p>Second, you can take a look at the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com\\\">source code</a>. While you need some knowledge of how Gatsby works, let me give you a sense of how this site is being generated. You can find all my blog posts and the main pages(<code>/</code>, <code>/about</code>, <code>/drafts</code>) of this site at <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com/tree/master/src/pages\\\"><code>/src/pages</code></a>. Common components can be found at <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com/tree/master/src/pages\\\"><code>/src/components</code></a>. At <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com/tree/master/src/pages\\\"><code>/gatsby-node.js</code></a> you can find the route it takes in order to render the site. First, it loads all posts using the GraphQL api which queries all <code>.md</code> files. Then it creates a page for each one, using the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com/tree/master/src/pages\\\"><code>/src/templates/blog-post.js</code></a> template and before that it creates a page, with pagination, for all posts and tags again using the appropriate template file.</p>\\n<p>On development, Gatsby will generate all of these in memory and fire up a development server that I can use to preview my site.</p>\\n<p>You can try it your self by cloning the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com\\\">source code</a> and after installing dependencies:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Hit <code>npm run develop</code> to fire up the development server</li>\\n<li>Hit <code>npm run build</code> to build the site (check the <code>/public</code> folder after its done)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>An alternative to HTML caching</h2>\\n<p>Static site generation can be seen as another form of caching your content. Think of when you are caching the home page of a Wordpress powered site and you are serving the cached content to every visitor. The thing though is that in many cases, there is no need for a system like Wordpress at all.</p>\\n<p>My personal site contains a list of blog posts and static information about me that I am updating it once in a while. Comments are being hosted on <a href=\\\"https://disqus.com\\\">Disqus</a>. There is absolutely no need for a system like Wordpress or even a system like <a href=\\\"https://ghost.org\\\">Ghost</a> which I have been using for the last 3 years. While it served me well all this time, I really got tired of updating it, ssh-ing to the server, doing migrations and doing other ops required by such a stack. While there are also options of hosting in the cloud, pretty much they will be paid and fairly enough, they deserve it for doing such a job.</p>\\n<p>But really, do I need a system like that? Not at all. And while we all know how much important that Wordpress' Admin UI is to maintain our content, I would argue that we can separate the backend from the frontend and have lots of new features built in automatically. Imagine that instead of having <a href=\\\"https://memcached.org/\\\">memcached</a> caching your HTML in front of your WordPress site, you trigger a hook each time your database changes that will re-generate the frontend using <a href=\\\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-wordpress/\\\">Gatsby</a>. Yes, Gatsby supports multiple backend sources to load your content. Instead of storing them inside your VCS like me, you can as well load them directly from your Wordpress's MySQL database.</p>\\n<p>So to conclude, modern static generators will allow us to:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>serve static content without maintaining complex stacks</li>\\n<li>keep a clear separation between the backend and the frontend</li>\\n<li>have cool features like client side routing and hot reload on development, out of the box</li>\\n<li>reuse the same code that is being used to generate the backend content at our visitors' browsers</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Hope that you will experiment with Gatsby and you will let me know of what you think.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/Bariotis/Dev/develop/kostasbariotis.com/src/pages/modern-static-site-generation/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"timeToRead\":6,\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"2017-08-14T00:00:00.000Z\",\"path\":\"/drafts/modern-static-site-generation/\",\"tags\":null,\"title\":\"Modern static site generation\",\"draft\":true}},{\"excerpt\":\"lets talk about over engineering trying to forecast the future e.g. We need an API to support our current 100 customers We need an API to support our current 100 customers plus another 100 that may come in the future\",\"html\":\"<p>lets talk about over engineering</p>\\n<p>trying to forecast the future</p>\\n<p>e.g. We need an API to support our current 100 customers</p>\\n<p>We need an API to support our current 100 customers plus another 100 that may come in the future</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/Bariotis/Dev/develop/kostasbariotis.com/src/pages/a-word-on-over-engineering/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"timeToRead\":1,\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"2017-06-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\"path\":\"/drafts/a-word-on-over-engineering/\",\"tags\":null,\"title\":\"A word on over engineering\",\"draft\":true}},{\"excerpt\":\"\",\"html\":\"\",\"id\":\"/Users/Bariotis/Dev/develop/kostasbariotis.com/src/pages/microservices-lets-talk-about-boundaries/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"timeToRead\":1,\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"2017-03-10T00:00:00.000Z\",\"path\":\"/drafts/microservices-lets-talk-about-boundaries/\",\"tags\":\"MicroServices\",\"title\":\"Microservices: lets talk about boundaries\",\"draft\":true}},{\"excerpt\":\"Static site generators are amazing tools, hands down!

I wouldn't say that it's the best since I've never used some other but I would love to hear from someone that has features that are missing from Jekyll.</p>\\n<p>So on this blog, I would like to present you with my minimal Jekyll configuration that I use on every site I work with. It has the form of a tutorial, so either follows steps below or grab directly the code from GitHub and start coding.</p>\\n<h2>Generate a new site</h2>\\n<p>Start by generating a new Jekyll project. Download and install <code>ruby</code>.</p>\\n<p><code>jekyll new .</code></p>\\n<h2>File and folders structure</h2>\\n<p>At first, you will notice that there is no markup at all. By default, Jekyll uses a theme that hides all that from you. But we need to inject our custom markup. Let's first remove the line <code>theme: minima</code> from _config.yml.</p>\\n<p>You will also notice a <code>_posts</code> folder with an example blog post inside. Let's not spend time on that. Maybe in another post. Delete the whole folder.</p>\\n<p>Now, open <code>about.md</code> and <code>index.md</code>. Those are the main pages of our site the index page and the about page. Every file you put there, Jekyll will generate a new page with that page in that path.</p>\\n<p>About's page content:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-yaml\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">---</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token key atrule\\\">layout</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> page\\n<span class=\\\"token key atrule\\\">title</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"About\\\"</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token key atrule\\\">permalink</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> /about/\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">---</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Now, this is Jekyll's frontmatter. We are requesting here this page to be generated with the default layout, have that specific title and be the <code>index.html</code> in the root directory. Jekyll will either copy paste every HTML file as is inside the final folder or will generate HTML files as told. This is what we do here, we are instructing Jekyll to generate an <code>index.html</code> file in the root directory.</p>\\n<p>Index page uses the home layout. But what are these layouts? Glad you finally asked. Those layouts were being hidden again by the default time. Let's write our own. Let's have one for start. Create the <code>_layouts/default.html</code> file and put inside:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-xml\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token doctype\\\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html></span>\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>html</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">lang</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span>en<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>head</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>meta</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">charset</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span>UTF-8<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>meta</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">name</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span>viewport<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span></span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">content</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span>width<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span>device-width, initial-scale<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span>1.0<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>meta</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">http-equiv</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span>X-UA-Compatible<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span></span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">content</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span>ie<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span>edge<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>title</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>Document<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>title</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>head</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>body</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n{{ content }}\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>body</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>html</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>This is a basic HTML structure with the <code>{{content}}</code> directive. This directive will render everything from a page that has extend that layout.</p>\\n<p>Great! Now we have a layout as well. I don't like HTML files laying around at the root directory. Let's have a separate folder for our pages. Create a <code>pages</code> folder in the root directory. The underscore demotes that this folder will be processed by Jekyll. Now we need an index page. Create an <code>index</code> folder inside <code>_pages</code> with an index.html file inside. Put inside the below snippet:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-yaml\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">---</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token key atrule\\\">layout</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> default\\n<span class=\\\"token key atrule\\\">title</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"WOW Jekyll\\\"</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token key atrule\\\">permalink</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> index.html\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">---</span>\\n&lt;h1<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span>Hello world&lt;/h1<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Do the same for the about page. This way, we will keep only configuration files in the root directory and have our content in respective folders.</p>\\n<p>Let's proceed with the 404 page. Same thing, create a <code>pages/404/index.html</code> with contents:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-yaml\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">---</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token key atrule\\\">layout</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> default\\n<span class=\\\"token key atrule\\\">title</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"404 Not Found\\\"</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token key atrule\\\">permalink</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> 404.html\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">---</span>\\n&lt;h1<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span>Not found&lt;/h1<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>And here's our 404 page that our HTTP server will server whenever doesn't find a corresponding route.</p>\\n<p>Fire <code>jekyll serve</code> and open the displayed link in your browser. You will see our index page.</p>\\n<p>Go to an undefined route and you will see our 404 page.</p>\\n<h2>Webpack integration</h2>\\n<p>Now that we have our basic file structure, we need a way to handle our frontend assets. I am using NPM for my JS dependencies. Same with CSS dependencies plus the SASS preprocessor. Let's first, create a folder to put all these there. Create a <code>_sources</code> folder and <code>js</code> and <code>sass</code> folders inside.</p>\\n<p>Let's first initialize NPM.</p>\\n<p><code>npm init</code></p>\\n<p>follow the instructions until you are finished.</p>\\n<p>Proceed with installing webpack and it's dependencies.</p>\\n<p><code>npm i --save webpack style-loader file-loader extract-text-webpack-plugin css-loader postcss-loader webpack-dev-server sass-loader node-sass webpack</code></p>\\n<p>Now let's install Bootstrap.</p>\\n<p><code>npm i --save bootstrap-sass</code></p>\\n<p>We are going to use a few Bootstrap's core modules like the typography and the grid. I am not going to use Bootstrap's JS modules since they require jQuery.</p>\\n<p>We will use <code>webpack</code> to process the files from that folder and put them inside <code>assets</code> folder. Jekyll will copy that folder inside the final build.</p>\\n<p>Create an <code>webpack.config.js</code> to the root directory. Put there the contents:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> webpack <span class=\\\"token

Why not make one for my-self and for the year past. I did set a few goals <a href=\\\"https://kostasbariotis.com/beyond-sunset/\\\">last year</a>.</p>\\n<h1>What I did</h1>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Travel more</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>I visited Bucharest, Romania in June for <a href=\\\"https://jscamp.ro\\\">jscamp.ro</a>. Didn't have the time to walk around a lot so I will get there again in any chance given to me. Also, visited Paris for the dotJS/dotCSS conferences. What a magnificent event!</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Read/Write more</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Nah, I can't say I'm satisfied with this one. I was watching a lot of blogs and I was reading Medium a lot. Didn't read all the books I wanted to read. I enjoyed Big Brother and The man and the see. I started Aurelia but never finished it. Zero to One was a great read as expected. Started Lean Analytics a few weeks ago.</p>\\n<p>But, I did start a podcast! [http://devastation.tv] started back in February and it's single purpose is learn a lot more and share those learning with my fellow greeks. Much like writing tech blogs posts!</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://kostasbariotis.com/data-migration-with-nodejs/\\\">\\\"Data Migrations with Node.js\\\"</a> was my most ridden piece this year.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Stay fit</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>I did a lot of running and I did notice a lot of improvement over the previous years. I didn't manage to make it my priority and a formal habit though. I still have to convince myself in order to get out of the building and go running. Still room for improvements here.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Speak to a big conference</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Does being listed in a <a href=\\\"http://2016.bulgariawebsummit.com/\\\">big conference's speaker</a> list as a speaker counts for this one? I did manage to get on that list but never made it to the conference. Everything was setup (thank you Bogo for you support, sorry for the mess) perfectly, there were two days left for the conference and I was about to travel by car the next day, until borders closed by Greek truck drivers riots. All three roads that could lead me to Sofia from Thessaloniki were closed. Airlines also do not favor Thessaloniki and I had to fly to Athens in order to land to Sofia. I was very disappointed with this one.</p>\\n<p>Nevertheless, I did fly to Athens mid-December to give a talk at GreeceJS, the biggest Javascript meetup in Athens. It was a great experience, met a lof of new people there. <em>Photos soon to come</em></p>\\n<p>2016 was also hiding a few other surprises. I left Goodvidio a month ago and now I am in the process of getting a new job. It has been 18 amazing months, full startup mode! Met some brilliant and wonderful guys over there. I am going to miss them for sure.</p>\\n<h1>Where to go next</h1>\\n<p>So, what's on for 2017? Well, I won't include the travel/read/speak/write thing! I want those to be parts of my life but I don't want to keep track of them. I will try this year too and even harder.</p>\\n<p>I will try to put a single goal for this year. I have been amazed by Universal Javascript trend that hit the since last year. I think 2017 will be a great year for Isomorphic applications along with progressive apps guidelines. I want this year to get my hands into and build myself an app that will follow all those principles.</p>\\n<p>That's my goal for 2017!</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/Bariotis/Dev/develop/kostasbariotis.com/src/pages/and-another-end/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"timeToRead\":2,\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"2016-12-25T00:00:00.000Z\",\"path\":\"/drafts/and-another-end/\",\"tags\":null,\"title\":\"And another end\",\"draft\":true}}],\"page\":1,\"pagesSum\":4,\"prevPath\":null,\"nextPath\":\"/drafts/page/2\"}}\n\n/***/ })\n\n});\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// path---drafts-page-1-170f707d9f375b3e94a9.js","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"Kostas Bariotis' Blog\",\"description\":\"I'm Kostas Bariotis, a web developer, a proud wanderer and a passionate doer.

They do one thing and they do it extremely well. I've build a ton of sites using Jekyll hosted either on GitHub either somewhere else. They all work pretty much the same way:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>You describe your content in some common templating language (JADE, Handlebars, etc)</li>\\n<li>While in development, start a local web server and add file \\\"watchers\\\" that will listen for content changes and re-render the site</li>\\n<li>Finally, you render the whole site in static HTML and deploy. The generator will combine your files and produce a well formed HTML content.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>For client side functionality, you have to keep the client side logic separated from the backend. Much like in an architecture where Wordpress is involved. So, pretty much nothing is changing. Literally, the difference from having a cached version of wordpress and content generated with Jekyll is none.</p>\\n<h2>Enter the new world order</h2>\\n<p>React.js! Aw yeah! We've heard about it! It's dominating the Web, but for a reason really. There are really so many reasons React.js have gained such a hype. Many of the techniques we will discuss here can be easily applied with other frameworks and libraries but React.js can play so nicely with them.</p>\\n<p>There is this function called Server Side Rendering where you can produce static HTML content directly from a tree of React.js components. That content will still contains the required React.js specific anotations needed so when the same tree will be loaded on the client, on top of the previously produced content, will know exactly what has to be rendered and what not to. From there, the client side logic can take the lead. Once the user visits a site, the server will directly respond with the static HTML. Once it's loaded in the user's browser and the user navigates in another route, the client side logic will respond and will render the new page, instead of contacting the server again. The same codebase will be used for the backend as also for the frontend. And that's really a game changer.</p>\\n<p>So let's see the new list:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Describe your content in React.js Components</li>\\n<li>On development time, write code like a boss (hot reloading, modularized code, webpack plugins, etc...)</li>\\n<li>Use React.js SSR API to produce the static content to be served on the backend, as well as the frontend side assets to be used on the visitor's browser</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Wait, what? Just like that?</h2>\\n<p>Yeah, I know. I made it look so easy. It's really not. There is the need for a strong abstraction that will track your links across your components, parse content written in another format, like blog posts written in Markdown, generate code that will not bloat the client and will efficiently server the content to the user.</p>\\n<p>Thankfully, there are a few projects that took the initiative and they are doing a great job so far. At the time of reading this, this site will already be served by GitHub pages and the content you will see once you view the source it's been generated by <a href=\\\"https://gatsbyjs.org\\\">Gatsby.js</a>.</p>\\n<p>I have been following those projects for quite a few time now. Here's my list:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://gatsbyjs.org\\\">Gatsby.js</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://phenomic.io\\\">Phenomic</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://nextein.now.sh\\\">nextein</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>At the time that I started following them, all of them were in a very early stage and none of them could generate my site's content the way I wanted and in the same way as my previous one so to not lose paths and certain functionalities. I wanted to make the generated site, exactly like the old one in terms of the user experience. Once Gatsby.js hitted major version 1, I started using it and the result..., you are looking at it!</p>\\n<h2>What exactly am I looking at?</h2>\\n<p>First, if you navigate around my site, you will notice that the browser doesn't fully re-renders the site. Gatsby will generate a JSON file for each route, so the browser can request only that file and React.js will render only the appropriate components. (Previously, I was using a technique called <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com__ghost-theme/blob/master/src/js/app.js#L11\\\">pjax</a> to create the same effect. While it looked the same, it was more hack-ish.)</p>\\n<p>Second, you can take a look at the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com\\\">source code</a>. While you need some knowledge of how Gatsby works, let me give you a sense of how this site is being generated. You can find all my blog posts and the main pages(<code>/</code>, <code>/about</code>, <code>/drafts</code>) of this site at <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com/tree/master/src/pages\\\"><code>/src/pages</code></a>. Common components can be found at <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com/tree/master/src/pages\\\"><code>/src/components</code></a>. At <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com/tree/master/src/pages\\\"><code>/gatsby-node.js</code></a> you can find the route it takes in order to render the site. First, it loads all posts using the GraphQL api which queries all <code>.md</code> files. Then it creates a page for each one, using the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com/tree/master/src/pages\\\"><code>/src/templates/blog-post.js</code></a> template and before that it creates a page, with pagination, for all posts and tags again using the appropriate template file.</p>\\n<p>On development, Gatsby will generate all of these in memory and fire up a development server that I can use to preview my site.</p>\\n<p>You can try it your self by cloning the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com\\\">source code</a> and after installing dependencies:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Hit <code>npm run develop</code> to fire up the development server</li>\\n<li>Hit <code>npm run build</code> to build the site (check the <code>/public</code> folder after its done)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>An alternative to HTML caching</h2>\\n<p>Static site generation can be seen as another form of caching your content. Think of when you are caching the home page of a Wordpress powered site and you are serving the cached content to every visitor. The thing though is that in many cases, there is no need for a system like Wordpress at all.</p>\\n<p>My personal site contains a list of blog posts and static information about me that I am updating it once in a while. Comments are being hosted on <a href=\\\"https://disqus.com\\\">Disqus</a>. There is absolutely no need for a system like Wordpress or even a system like <a href=\\\"https://ghost.org\\\">Ghost</a> which I have been using for the last 3 years. While it served me well all this time, I really got tired of updating it, ssh-ing to the server, doing migrations and doing other ops required by such a stack. While there are also options of hosting in the cloud, pretty much they will be paid and fairly enough, they deserve it for doing such a job.</p>\\n<p>But really, do I need a system like that? Not at all. And while we all know how much important that Wordpress' Admin UI is to maintain our content, I would argue that we can separate the backend from the frontend and have lots of new features built in automatically. Imagine that instead of having <a href=\\\"https://memcached.org/\\\">memcached</a> caching your HTML in front of your WordPress site, you trigger a hook each time your database changes that will re-generate the frontend using <a href=\\\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-wordpress/\\\">Gatsby</a>. Yes, Gatsby supports multiple backend sources to load your content. Instead of storing them inside your VCS like me, you can as well load them directly from your Wordpress's MySQL database.</p>\\n<p>So to conclude, modern static generators will allow us to:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>serve static content without maintaining complex stacks</li>\\n<li>keep a clear separation between the backend and the frontend</li>\\n<li>have cool features like client side routing and hot reload on development, out of the box</li>\\n<li>reuse the same code that is being used to generate the backend content at our visitors' browsers</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Hope that you will experiment with Gatsby and you will let me know of what you think.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/Bariotis/Dev/develop/kostasbariotis.com/src/pages/modern-static-site-generation/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"timeToRead\":6,\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"2017-08-14T00:00:00.000Z\",\"path\":\"/drafts/modern-static-site-generation/\",\"tags\":null,\"title\":\"Modern static site generation\",\"draft\":true}},{\"excerpt\":\"lets talk about over engineering trying to forecast the future e.g. We need an API to support our current 100 customers We need an API to support our current 100 customers plus another 100 that may come in the future\",\"html\":\"<p>lets talk about over engineering</p>\\n<p>trying to forecast the future</p>\\n<p>e.g. We need an API to support our current 100 customers</p>\\n<p>We need an API to support our current 100 customers plus another 100 that may come in the future</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/Bariotis/Dev/develop/kostasbariotis.com/src/pages/a-word-on-over-engineering/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"timeToRead\":1,\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"2017-06-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\"path\":\"/drafts/a-word-on-over-engineering/\",\"tags\":null,\"title\":\"A word on over engineering\",\"draft\":true}},{\"excerpt\":\"\",\"html\":\"\",\"id\":\"/Users/Bariotis/Dev/develop/kostasbariotis.com/src/pages/microservices-lets-talk-about-boundaries/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"timeToRead\":1,\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"2017-03-10T00:00:00.000Z\",\"path\":\"/drafts/microservices-lets-talk-about-boundaries/\",\"tags\":\"MicroServices\",\"title\":\"Microservices: lets talk about boundaries\",\"draft\":true}},{\"excerpt\":\"Static site generators are amazing tools, hands down!

I wouldn't say that it's the best since I've never used some other but I would love to hear from someone that has features that are missing from Jekyll.</p>\\n<p>So on this blog, I would like to present you with my minimal Jekyll configuration that I use on every site I work with. It has the form of a tutorial, so either follows steps below or grab directly the code from GitHub and start coding.</p>\\n<h2>Generate a new site</h2>\\n<p>Start by generating a new Jekyll project. Download and install <code>ruby</code>.</p>\\n<p><code>jekyll new .</code></p>\\n<h2>File and folders structure</h2>\\n<p>At first, you will notice that there is no markup at all. By default, Jekyll uses a theme that hides all that from you. But we need to inject our custom markup. Let's first remove the line <code>theme: minima</code> from _config.yml.</p>\\n<p>You will also notice a <code>_posts</code> folder with an example blog post inside. Let's not spend time on that. Maybe in another post. Delete the whole folder.</p>\\n<p>Now, open <code>about.md</code> and <code>index.md</code>. Those are the main pages of our site the index page and the about page. Every file you put there, Jekyll will generate a new page with that page in that path.</p>\\n<p>About's page content:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-yaml\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">---</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token key atrule\\\">layout</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> page\\n<span class=\\\"token key atrule\\\">title</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"About\\\"</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token key atrule\\\">permalink</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> /about/\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">---</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Now, this is Jekyll's frontmatter. We are requesting here this page to be generated with the default layout, have that specific title and be the <code>index.html</code> in the root directory. Jekyll will either copy paste every HTML file as is inside the final folder or will generate HTML files as told. This is what we do here, we are instructing Jekyll to generate an <code>index.html</code> file in the root directory.</p>\\n<p>Index page uses the home layout. But what are these layouts? Glad you finally asked. Those layouts were being hidden again by the default time. Let's write our own. Let's have one for start. Create the <code>_layouts/default.html</code> file and put inside:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-xml\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token doctype\\\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html></span>\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>html</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">lang</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span>en<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>head</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>meta</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">charset</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span>UTF-8<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>meta</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">name</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span>viewport<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span></span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">content</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span>width<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span>device-width, initial-scale<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span>1.0<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>meta</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">http-equiv</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span>X-UA-Compatible<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span></span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">content</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span>ie<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span>edge<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>title</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>Document<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>title</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>head</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>body</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n{{ content }}\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>body</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>html</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>This is a basic HTML structure with the <code>{{content}}</code> directive. This directive will render everything from a page that has extend that layout.</p>\\n<p>Great! Now we have a layout as well. I don't like HTML files laying around at the root directory. Let's have a separate folder for our pages. Create a <code>pages</code> folder in the root directory. The underscore demotes that this folder will be processed by Jekyll. Now we need an index page. Create an <code>index</code> folder inside <code>_pages</code> with an index.html file inside. Put inside the below snippet:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-yaml\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">---</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token key atrule\\\">layout</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> default\\n<span class=\\\"token key atrule\\\">title</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"WOW Jekyll\\\"</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token key atrule\\\">permalink</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> index.html\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">---</span>\\n&lt;h1<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span>Hello world&lt;/h1<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Do the same for the about page. This way, we will keep only configuration files in the root directory and have our content in respective folders.</p>\\n<p>Let's proceed with the 404 page. Same thing, create a <code>pages/404/index.html</code> with contents:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-yaml\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">---</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token key atrule\\\">layout</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> default\\n<span class=\\\"token key atrule\\\">title</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"404 Not Found\\\"</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token key atrule\\\">permalink</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> 404.html\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">---</span>\\n&lt;h1<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span>Not found&lt;/h1<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>And here's our 404 page that our HTTP server will server whenever doesn't find a corresponding route.</p>\\n<p>Fire <code>jekyll serve</code> and open the displayed link in your browser. You will see our index page.</p>\\n<p>Go to an undefined route and you will see our 404 page.</p>\\n<h2>Webpack integration</h2>\\n<p>Now that we have our basic file structure, we need a way to handle our frontend assets. I am using NPM for my JS dependencies. Same with CSS dependencies plus the SASS preprocessor. Let's first, create a folder to put all these there. Create a <code>_sources</code> folder and <code>js</code> and <code>sass</code> folders inside.</p>\\n<p>Let's first initialize NPM.</p>\\n<p><code>npm init</code></p>\\n<p>follow the instructions until you are finished.</p>\\n<p>Proceed with installing webpack and it's dependencies.</p>\\n<p><code>npm i --save webpack style-loader file-loader extract-text-webpack-plugin css-loader postcss-loader webpack-dev-server sass-loader node-sass webpack</code></p>\\n<p>Now let's install Bootstrap.</p>\\n<p><code>npm i --save bootstrap-sass</code></p>\\n<p>We are going to use a few Bootstrap's core modules like the typography and the grid. I am not going to use Bootstrap's JS modules since they require jQuery.</p>\\n<p>We will use <code>webpack</code> to process the files from that folder and put them inside <code>assets</code> folder. Jekyll will copy that folder inside the final build.</p>\\n<p>Create an <code>webpack.config.js</code> to the root directory. Put there the contents:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> webpack <span class=\\\"token

main <code>scss</code> file and put it into <code>assets/css/style.css</code>. Jekyll will be able to grab it from there. Also, JS files will be processed, be bundled and put into <code>assets/js</code> as a separate file for each of our pages.</p>\\n<p>Last, we have enabled <code>webpack-dev-server</code> and make it a proxy to Jekyll's host and port. So, in order to use it and have all the good stuff like Hot module replacement we will use that server on development.</p>\\n<p>All we need now is to include them into our layout file.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-html\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token doctype\\\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html></span>\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>html</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">lang</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span>en<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>head</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>meta</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">charset</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span>UTF-8<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>meta</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">name</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span>viewport<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span></span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">content</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span>width<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span>device-width, initial-scale<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span>1.0<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>meta</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">http-equiv</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span>X-UA-Compatible<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span></span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">content</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span>ie<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span>edge<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>title</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>{{page.title || site.title}}<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>title</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n  &lt;link rel=\\\"stylesheet\\\" href../static/css/main.css\\\">\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>head</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>body</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n{{ content }}\\n&lt;script src../static/js/entry.js\\\"><span class=\\\"token script language-javascript\\\"></span><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>script</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>body</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>html</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Fire up webpack's dev server:</p>\\n<p><code>./node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server --inline --hot</code></p>\\n<h2>NPM Scripts</h2>\\n<p>Now that everything is in place, we want to take advantage of webpack's cool dev features like hot module replacement, etc. To do this we need</p>\\n<h2>Deployment</h2>\",\"id\":\"/Users/Bariotis/Dev/develop/kostasbariotis.com/src/pages/Jekyll + webpack = ❤️/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"timeToRead\":5,\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"2017-02-25T00:00:00.000Z\",\"path\":\"/drafts/jekyll-webpack/\",\"tags\":null,\"title\":\"Jekyll + webpack = ❤️\",\"draft\":true}},{\"excerpt\":\"Aw man!

Why not make one for my-self and for the year past. I did set a few goals <a href=\\\"https://kostasbariotis.com/beyond-sunset/\\\">last year</a>.</p>\\n<h1>What I did</h1>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Travel more</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>I visited Bucharest, Romania in June for <a href=\\\"https://jscamp.ro\\\">jscamp.ro</a>. Didn't have the time to walk around a lot so I will get there again in any chance given to me. Also, visited Paris for the dotJS/dotCSS conferences. What a magnificent event!</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Read/Write more</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Nah, I can't say I'm satisfied with this one. I was watching a lot of blogs and I was reading Medium a lot. Didn't read all the books I wanted to read. I enjoyed Big Brother and The man and the see. I started Aurelia but never finished it. Zero to One was a great read as expected. Started Lean Analytics a few weeks ago.</p>\\n<p>But, I did start a podcast! [http://devastation.tv] started back in February and it's single purpose is learn a lot more and share those learning with my fellow greeks. Much like writing tech blogs posts!</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://kostasbariotis.com/data-migration-with-nodejs/\\\">\\\"Data Migrations with Node.js\\\"</a> was my most ridden piece this year.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Stay fit</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>I did a lot of running and I did notice a lot of improvement over the previous years. I didn't manage to make it my priority and a formal habit though. I still have to convince myself in order to get out of the building and go running. Still room for improvements here.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Speak to a big conference</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Does being listed in a <a href=\\\"http://2016.bulgariawebsummit.com/\\\">big conference's speaker</a> list as a speaker counts for this one? I did manage to get on that list but never made it to the conference. Everything was setup (thank you Bogo for you support, sorry for the mess) perfectly, there were two days left for the conference and I was about to travel by car the next day, until borders closed by Greek truck drivers riots. All three roads that could lead me to Sofia from Thessaloniki were closed. Airlines also do not favor Thessaloniki and I had to fly to Athens in order to land to Sofia. I was very disappointed with this one.</p>\\n<p>Nevertheless, I did fly to Athens mid-December to give a talk at GreeceJS, the biggest Javascript meetup in Athens. It was a great experience, met a lof of new people there. <em>Photos soon to come</em></p>\\n<p>2016 was also hiding a few other surprises. I left Goodvidio a month ago and now I am in the process of getting a new job. It has been 18 amazing months, full startup mode! Met some brilliant and wonderful guys over there. I am going to miss them for sure.</p>\\n<h1>Where to go next</h1>\\n<p>So, what's on for 2017? Well, I won't include the travel/read/speak/write thing! I want those to be parts of my life but I don't want to keep track of them. I will try this year too and even harder.</p>\\n<p>I will try to put a single goal for this year. I have been amazed by Universal Javascript trend that hit the since last year. I think 2017 will be a great year for Isomorphic applications along with progressive apps guidelines. I want this year to get my hands into and build myself an app that will follow all those principles.</p>\\n<p>That's my goal for 2017!</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/Bariotis/Dev/develop/kostasbariotis.com/src/pages/and-another-end/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"timeToRead\":2,\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"2016-12-25T00:00:00.000Z\",\"path\":\"/drafts/and-another-end/\",\"tags\":null,\"title\":\"And another end\",\"draft\":true}}],\"page\":1,\"pagesSum\":4,\"prevPath\":null,\"nextPath\":\"/drafts/page/2\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/drafts-page-1.json\n// module id = ./node_modules/json-loader/index.js!./.cache/json/drafts-page-1.json\n// module chunks = 160"],"sourceRoot":""}
