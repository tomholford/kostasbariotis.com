Especially when you are young and inexperienced.</p>\n<p>But you should be hungry for interviews, cause every one of them is just an experience itself.\nUsually, you have to pass a highly experienced interviewer and sometimes maybe you will meet some of the big stems of the company.</p>\n<p>Something people are missing is that a job interview is not a one-way road. While the company's people want to know more about you, you must get to know more about them. Ask some questions, take a good look at the facilities/offices. Observe people's movements, talk styles, and dress codes.</p>\n<p>One thing that I have gained after so many interviews is that I can simply get into a room and just know if I really want to work there. Joy, collaboration, chill atmosphere are things that can't be concealed.</p>\n<p>After a lot of interviews, I have kept some notes of what I shall ask during one. Here there are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>What will my job be? At first and after few months?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What is your work policy for employees?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Software/hardware that I will get?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Can I participate on/run side projects?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Is there a budget for conferences, further education, bonus?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What is the history of this company and how do you see the future?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Will you measure my productivity and how?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those are just simple questions you can ask. The point here is that you are in a position of knowing more about this company. It's not something you should afraid of or feeling awkward.</p>\n<p>A job interview should always be a two ways road.
