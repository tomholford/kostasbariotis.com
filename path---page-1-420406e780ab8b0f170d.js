How they have evolved and why I switched from a <a href="https://ghost.org">Ghost</a> powered site to <a href="https://gatsbyjs.org">Gatsby.js</a>, a modern static site generator.</p>\n<h2>Static site generators as we know them</h2>\n<p><a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, <a href="https://hexo.io">Hexo</a>, <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. They do one thing and they do it well. I\'ve built a ton of sites using Jekyll hosted either on GitHub either somewhere else. They all work pretty much the same way:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You describe your content in some common templating language (<a href="pugjs.org">Pug</a>, <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com">Handlebars</a>, etc)</li>\n<li>While in development, start a local web server and add file "watchers" that will listen for content changes and re-render the site</li>\n<li>Finally, you render the whole site in static HTML and deploy. The generator will combine your files and produce a well formed HTML content.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A caveat here is that you have to keep the client side logic separated from the backend. Much like in an architecture where Wordpress is involved. So, pretty much nothing is changing. The difference from having a cached version of Wordpress and content generated with Jekyll is none.</p>\n<h2>Enter the new world order</h2>\n<p><a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React.js</a>! Awww yeah! We\'ve heard about it! It\'s dominating the Web, but for a reason. There are so many reasons React.js have gained such a hype. Many of the techniques we will discuss here can be easily applied to other frameworks and libraries but React.js can play so nicely with them.</p>\n<p>There is this function called <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-dom-server.html">Server Side Rendering</a> where you can produce static HTML content directly from a tree of React.js components. That HTML content will contain the required React.js specific annotations so when the same tree will be loaded on the client, on top of the previously produced content, will know exactly what has to be rendered and what not to. From there, the client side logic can take the lead. Once the user visits a site, the server will respond with the static HTML. Once it\'s loaded in the user\'s browser and the user navigates in another route, the client side logic will respond and will render the new page, instead of contacting the server again. The same codebase will be used for the backend as also for the frontend. And that\'s a game changer.</p>\n<p>So let\'s see the new list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Describe your content in React.js Components</li>\n<li>On development time, write code like a boss (hot reloading, modularized code, webpack plugins, etc...)</li>\n<li>Use React.js SSR API to produce the static content to be served on the backend, as well as the frontend side assets to be used on the visitor\'s browser</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Wait, what? Like that?</h2>\n<p>Yeah, I know. I made it look so easy. It\'s not. There is the need for a strong abstraction that will track your links across your components, parse content written in another format, like blog posts written in Markdown, generate code that will not bloat the client and will efficiently serve the content to the user.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, there are a few projects that took the initiative and they are doing a great job so far. At the time of reading this, this site will already be served by GitHub pages and the content you will see once you view the source it\'s been generated by <a href="https://gatsbyjs.org">Gatsby.js</a>.</p>\n<p>I have been following those projects for quite a while. Here\'s my list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://gatsbyjs.org">Gatsby.js</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://phenomic.io">Phenomic</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://nextein.now.sh">nextein</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the time that I started following them, all of them were in a very early stage and none of them could generate my site\'s content the way I wanted and in the same way as my previous one so to not lose paths and certain functionalities. I wanted to make the generated site, exactly like the old one in terms of the user experience. Once Gatsby.js hit major version 1, I started using it and the result..., you are looking at it!</p>\n<h2>What exactly am I looking at?</h2>\n<p>First, if you navigate around my site, you will notice that the browser doesn\'t fully re-renders the site. Gatsby will generate a JSON file for each route, so the browser can request only that file and React.js will render only the appropriate components. (Previously, I was using a technique called <a href="https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com__ghost-theme/blob/master/src/js/app.js#L11">pjax</a> to create the same effect. While it looked the same, it was more hack-ish.)</p>\n<p>Second, you can take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com">source code</a>. While you need some knowledge of how Gatsby works, let me give you a sense of how this site is being generated. You can find all my blog posts and the main pages(<code>/</code>, <code>/about</code>, <code>/drafts</code>) of this site at <a href="https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com/tree/master/src/pages"><code>/src/pages</code></a>. Common components can be found at <a href="https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com/tree/master/src/components"><code>/src/components</code></a>. At <a href="https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com/tree/master/gatsby-node.js"><code>/gatsby-node.js</code></a> you can find the route it takes in order to render the site. First, it loads all posts using the GraphQL api which queries all <code>.md</code> files. Then it creates a page for each one, using the <a href="https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com/tree/master/src/templates/blog-post.js"><code>/src/templates/blog-post.js</code></a> template and before that it creates a page, with pagination, for all posts and tags again using the appropriate template file.</p>\n<p>On development, Gatsby will generate all of these in memory and fire up a development server that I can use to preview my site.</p>\n<p>You can try it your self by cloning the <a href="https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com">source code</a> and after installing dependencies, hit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>npm run develop</code> to fire up the development server</li>\n<li><code>npm run build</code> to build the site (check the <code>/public</code> folder after its done)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>An alternative to HTML caching</h2>\n<p>Static site generation can be seen as another form of caching your content. Think of when you are caching the home page of a Wordpress powered site and you are serving the cached content to every visitor. The thing though is that in many cases, there is no need for a system like Wordpress at all.</p>\n<p>My personal site contains a list of blog posts and static information about me that I am updating it once in a while. Comments are being hosted on <a href="https://disqus.com">Disqus</a>. There is absolutely no need for a system like Wordpress or even a system like <a href="https://ghost.org">Ghost</a> which I have been using for the last 3 years. While it served me well all this time, I really got tired of updating it, ssh-ing to the server, doing migrations and doing other ops required by such a stack. While there are also options for hosting in the cloud, pretty much they will be paid and fairly enough, they deserve it for doing such a job.</p>\n<p>But do I need a system like that? Not at all. And while we all know how much important that Wordpress\' Admin UI is to maintain our content, I would argue that we can separate the backend from the frontend and have lots of new features built in automatically. Imagine that instead of having <a href="https://memcached.org/">memcached</a> caching your HTML in front of your WordPress site, you trigger a hook each time your database changes that will re-generate the frontend using <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-wordpress/">Gatsby</a>. Yes, Gatsby supports multiple backend sources to load your content. Instead of storing them inside your VCS like me, you can as well load them from your Wordpress\'s MySQL database.</p>\n<p>To conclude, modern static generators will allow us to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>serve static content without maintaining complex stacks</li>\n<li>keep a clear separation between the backend and the frontend</li>\n<li>have cool features like client side routing and hot reload on development, out of the box</li>\n<li>reuse the same code that is being used to generate the backend content at our visitors\' browsers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hope that you will experiment with Gatsby and you will let me know what you think.</p>',id:"/Users/Bariotis/Dev/develop/kostasbariotis.com/src/pages/modern-static-site-generation/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:6,frontmatter:{date:"2017-08-18T00:00:00.000Z",path:"/modern-static-site-generation/",tags:"node.js, reactjs, javascript",title:"Modern static site generation",draft:null}},{excerpt:"I started looking for a remote position, telecommuting in other words, as a software engineer last November.

It took me 3 months to apply to ~150 job descriptions and none of them was a successful hire. Nevertheless, I now have a great job and I would like to share that experience with you. I have prepared a spreadsheet listing anonymous applications, whether they rejected me or I rejected them and till which level I got into. I will also share my cover letter and how I approached the remote job hunting.</p>\n<h2>Why a remote position?</h2>\n<p>After quite a few years doing this job, I have become quite selective when it comes to my next job. I need myself to be a good fit on the team and the team to be a good fit for me. I don\'t like big established corporations cause there is almost never anything interesting for me there. I like small ambitious teams, flexible enough to do one week sprints and put all of their heart in every sprint. I want the team\'s long-term goals to be my long term goals so I can put myself in it.</p>\n<p>I would call them "startups" just because it\'s cool nowadays, but I won\'t because that\'s simply not what I am all about. Startups are all about high risk, I am not (at least not at this point).</p>\n<p>While Greece had quite a few success stories of such teams, my hometown Thessaloniki, in northern Greece is not that famous for their startup environment. Leaving Greece wasn\'t possible at the moment so I thought I would chase a remote position especially after having lots of local friends who work for big companies like, GitHub, Automattic, etc.</p>\n<p>Let one not forget, there is also the compensation parameter that says that you can enter a better-paid market than your local market, which is no debatable for my local market.</p>\n<p>So I thought I would give it a try.</p>\n<h2>The setup</h2>\n<p>The setup when you do job hunting has everything to do with how you present yourself in the online world. How I present myself you ask? Well, you are looking at it. This web page contains everything you need to know about me, all the projects I am working on, everything I have share with my readers, lots of my views about stuff (ok not everything, but you get the idea). You can find all my social profiles (GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc) through this web page and lots of other places are linking back to my blog posts.</p>\n<p>But to make the recruiter to visit my page, I had to go through her mailbox first. So I tried to write a catchy email worthy enough to make her click my web page. Keep in mind that I am not targeting a big corporation but rather a team where the casual speech is usual. I wanted to write an email that will automatically filter out the "serious" guys and attract the more friendly ones. That\'s why the friendly tone.</p>\n<p>This is the final version of it because I had to do some revises after I sent it a few times.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dear Mr/Ms,</p>\n<p>I am Kostas Bariotis, a software developer and a passionate doer. I am sending you my regards from sunny Thessaloniki, Greece. Have you ever been? Take a look, I am sure you will fall in love with the amazing beaches of Chalkidiki.</p>\n<p>I am currently looking for a product and a team that I would be a great fit in. I stumbled upon your job description and I would really love it to talk more with you guys. I have been working with Node.js for the past three years. (<strong>This is where I explain why I would be a good fit for that particular position</strong>)</p>\n<p>I am obsessed with clean and efficient code. I am interested in designing software architectures, APIs and databases to serve the rest of an application. I am a full stack developer yet I love taking a specific field in my hands and getting the juice out of it. I am interested in being a part of a team that builds great software. I have spent the last two years with the <a href="https://goodvid.io">Goodvid.io</a> team to serve e-commerce sites with curated product videos.</p>\n<p>My blog is my personal playground, I am also doing a lot of public speaking talking a lot about tech stuff and also talking with others on my podcast. Stargento and <a href="https://gityeller.com">GitYeller</a> are two of my side projects. You can find more code samples and my contributions on <a href="https://github.com/kbariotis">Github</a>. Along with some folks, we are organizing the local <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Thessaloniki-Node-js-Meetup/">Nodejs meetup</a> and <a href="http://devitconf.org">Devit Conf</a>, the biggest web development conference in northern Greece. We are also known as <a href="https://skgtech.io">SKGTech</a>.</p>\n<p>Last, but not least, I love reading books, mainly science fiction, traveling and attending conferences and meetups, snowboarding and staying fit. Calisthenics class is my latest activity that takes a lot of my time.</p>\n<p>I would love it if we could arrange a talk and talk more about how I could potentially be a fit for your team. Please, consult my resume or see the links below.</p>\n<p>Thank you so much and have a nice day. :)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Where did I look?</h2>\n<p>Nowadays there are lots of places to find a remote position, especially in software engineering. Here\'s my list of preference:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://weworkremotely.com/">weworkremotely.com</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/jobs?sort=i&#x26;r=true">Stackoverflow Jobs</a> (with <code>Offers remote</code> filter on)</li>\n<li><a href="http://angel.co">Angel.co</a> (mostly known for early stages companies)</li>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/jessicard/remote-jobs">https://github.com/jessicard/remote-jobs</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/lukasz-madon/awesome-remote-job">https://github.com/lukasz-madon/awesome-remote-job</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The results</h2>\n<p>Like I said I didn\'t have a successful hire after all. Lots of companies showed interest in me and lots of others didn\'t even bother contacting me back.</p>\n<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17w6jiewdPQSgSL3Rripit2RdjWcR_I_m7ObBObmQAh0/edit?usp=sharing">I have gathered over 70 applications</a> the months that I was looking for a job. Keep in mind that these are only those that I had some sort of communication through email or some other mean. I also did lots of applications on Angel.co and other similar sites that I\'ve never heard back. The sum of the applications must exceed those 70 by far.</p>\n<h2>What I have learned</h2>\n<p>The progress I had with each company varies. It\'s interesting to see how many contacted me back and how many wanted to do an <a href="https://kostasbariotis.com/interviewer-vs-interviewee/">interview</a> and how many interviews did I took on average with each company. I believe, though, that the most interesting part is that with over 70 applications I did, I took back like 3 offers which lead me to the conclusion that the market of the remote positions is highly competitive and it\'s really hard to find the job that you would be happy enough.</p>\n<p>As you enter a bigger market of potential employers, the same way they enter a bigger market of potential employees. Most of the times, the best yet the cheapest at their fields are those who get hired.</p>\n<p>But that\'s ok, cause this makes the market grow. There are still these companies that are looking for other parameters and don\'t care about the cost that much, but these companies have higher expectations and juniors/mid developers are often not being considered that easily.</p>\n<p>I am back on track now on a great team and an amazing environment in the heart of Thessaloniki. I am not rejecting the idea of working remotely entirely but I will leave it aside for now.</p>\n<p>Hope that you liked this post.</p>',id:"/Users/Bariotis/Dev/develop/kostasbariotis.com/src/pages/how-i-failed-landing-a-remote-position/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:5,frontmatter:{date:"2017-07-07T17:43:00.000Z",path:"/how-i-failed-landing-a-remote-position/",tags:"interviews, job, engineers",title:"How I failed landing a remote position",draft:null}},{excerpt:"I am using webpack a lot.

Then I will show you two common techniques and why I chose the second one. It\'s fairly small as the horizontal scrollbar on right says.</p>\n<h2>An example</h2>\n<p>Let\'s start with a simple app. Of course, it does absolutely nothing. It\'s just a theoretical fully working application:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-js"><code><span class="token keyword">import</span> ApolloClient<span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span> createNetworkInterface <span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token keyword">from</span> <span class="token string">\'apollo-client\'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token keyword">import</span> gql <span class="token keyword">from</span> <span class="token string">\'graphql-tag\'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token keyword">import</span> Raven <span class="token keyword">from</span> <span class="token string">\'raven-js\'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n\n<span class="token keyword">const</span> client <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">new</span> <span class="token class-name">ApolloClient</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n  networkInterface<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token function">createNetworkInterface</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n    uri<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">\'https://graphql.example.com\'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n  <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n\nRaven<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">config</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">\'https://4a426bd18cd86e90b186dcbfa3ce1b0d@sentry.io/321321\'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">install</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n\nclient<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">query</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n  query<span class="token punctuation">:</span> gql<span class="token template-string"><span class="token string">`\n    query TodoApp {\n      todos {\n        id\n        text\n        completed\n      }\n    }\n  `</span></span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>\n  <span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">then</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>data <span class="token operator">=></span> console<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>data<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>\n  <span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token keyword">catch</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>error <span class="token operator">=></span> Raven<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">captureException</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>error<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Notice the various constants across this simple snippet. We have our GraphQL\'s API Url and the Sentry\'s access code. We want to build the above snippet for two different environments, the production one, and the staging. But we want the production environment to talk to our production GraphQL API while the staging to talk to the staging one. The same goes for the Sentry access code, different for every environment (Sentry supports error tags though, that\'s just an example.)</p>\n<p>Great so let\'s rewrite:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-js"><code><span class="token keyword">import</span> ApolloClient<span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span> createNetworkInterface <span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token keyword">from</span> <span class="token string">\'apollo-client\'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token keyword">import</span> gql <span class="token keyword">from</span> <span class="token string">\'graphql-tag\'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n\n<span class="token keyword">const</span> client <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">new</span> <span class="token class-name">ApolloClient</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n  networkInterface<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token function">createNetworkInterface</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n    uri<span class="token punctuation">:</span> __CONFIG__<span class="token punctuation">.</span>graphql<span class="token punctuation">.</span>endpoint<span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n  <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n\nRaven<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">config</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>__CONFIG__<span class="token punctuation">.</span>sentry<span class="token punctuation">.</span>code<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">install</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n\nclient<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">query</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n  query<span class="token punctuation">:</span> gql<span class="token template-string"><span class="token string">`\n    query TodoApp {\n      todos {\n        id\n        text\n        completed\n      }\n    }\n  `</span></span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>\n  <span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">then</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>data <span class="token operator">=></span> console<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>data<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>\n  <span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token keyword">catch</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>error <span class="token operator">=></span> Raven<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">captureException</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>error<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Great! Notice the constants I have put in. Now we need to properly assign those constants depending on the environment.</p>\n<p>Before we do that, let\'s take it a step further.

When it\'s false, will never initialize it.</p>\n<h2>Searching for a solution</h2>\n<p>Let\'s see now how we can actually achieve this. First, we need the configuration management. <a href="https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config">node-config</a> would be great for this. Just install it, write some configuration files and load it in your webpack configuration like this:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-none"><code>const config = require(\'node-config\');</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p><code>config</code> here will be the environment specific configuration you have defined. Now we need to inject that into our application entry file.</p>\n<p>One way would be to create a module alias. Then you can just import from every file you are going to need it. Although you may need to adjust it a bit to use it with <code>node-config</code>, it\'s fairly simple and works in most cases.</p>\n<p>One caveat here is that the configuration is being imported into your application and just sits there, whether you are using it or not. Configuration values that are not being used are still there, which may even be considered as a security flaw. We don\'t want that.</p>\n<p>A better solution would be webpack\'s <a href="https://webpack.js.org/plugins/define-plugin/">DefinePlugin</a>. DefinePlugin will replace every occurrence of a key you are passing it with its respective value on compile time.</p>\n<p>So this:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-js"><code><span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>__CONFIG__<span class="token punctuation">.</span>sentry<span class="token punctuation">.</span>is_enabled<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n  <span class="token keyword">import</span> Raven <span class="token keyword">from</span> <span class="token string">\'raven-js\'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n  Raven<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">config</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>__CONFIG__<span class="token punctuation">.</span>sentry<span class="token punctuation">.</span>code<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">install</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>will become</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-js"><code><span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token boolean">false</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n  <span class="token keyword">import</span> Raven <span class="token keyword">from</span> <span class="token string">\'raven-js\'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n  Raven<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">config</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>__CONFIG__<span class="token punctuation">.</span>sentry<span class="token punctuation">.</span>code<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">install</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>on the staging environment. What\'s even greater about that, is that webpack will pass it (using UglifyJS) and completely remove it since it\'s never going to be used.</p>\n<p>Heads up though!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note that because the plugin does a direct text replacement, the value given to it must include actual quotes inside of the string itself. Typically, this is done either with either alternate quotes, such as \'"production"\', or by using JSON.stringify(\'production\').</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You need to write your configuration respectively because of that.</p>\n<p>The webpack configuration will look like this:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-js"><code><span class="token keyword">const</span> path <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">require</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">\'path\'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token keyword">const</span> webpack <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">require</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">\'webpack\'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token keyword">const</span> config <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">require</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">\'config\'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n\nmodule<span class="token punctuation">.</span>exports <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n  entry<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">\'./index.js\'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n  plugins<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span>\n    <span class="token keyword">new</span> <span class="token class-name">webpack<span class="token punctuation">.</span>DefinePlugin</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n      __CONFIG__<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token function">packinize</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>config<span class="token punctuation">)</span>\n    <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>\n  <span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n  output<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n    filename<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">\'app.bundle.js\'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n    path<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"/path.join(__dirname, \'dist\')/"</span>\n  <span class="token punctuation">}</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>We pass <code>node-config</code> into <code>packinize</code> which will pass every value and stringify it. Then we feed the result into DefinePlugin.</p>\n<h2>To conclude</h2>\n<p>I am using configuration files as much as possible. For constants that are being varied based on the environments, API URLs, access codes, feature flags, toggle switches. Being able to manipulate the end code based on those values is just awesome!</p>\n<p>I have added an example to my <a href="http://github.com/kbariotis/webpack-patterns">webpack-patterns collection</a>. Take a look and let me know what you think.</p>\n<p>How are you using your application specific configuration when you use webpack? Or any other bundler?</p>',

But still, it\'s a big deal in our day to day life and you always feel good by the outcome.</p>\n<p>Personally, I am reusing whatever I can get off the internet and the open source community. <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> is an example of this. Bootstrap is a fine set of reusable components you can just plug into your website. The thing is that it\'s quite big and usually you won\'t be needing all of the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/">components</a> it offers.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the latest version of Bootstrap still requires jQuery which I am trying to avoid. Especially for smaller projects that have a few click events and a contact form, it\'s really not that necessary.</p>\n<p>So, like a true hacker, I am using SASS to build my CSS files and my main file looks like this at first:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-scss"><code><span class="token property"><span class="token variable">$bootstrap-sass-asset-helper</span></span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token boolean">true</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n\n<span class="token keyword">@import</span> <span class="token string">"~bootstrap-sa../static/stylesheets/bootstrap/variables"</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token keyword">@import</span> <span class="token string">"~bootstrap-sa../static/stylesheets/bootstrap/mixins"</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token keyword">@import</span> <span class="token string">"~bootstrap-sa../static/stylesheets/bootstrap/normalize"</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token keyword">@import</span> <span class="token string">"~bootstrap-sa../static/stylesheets/bootstrap/print"</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token keyword">@import</span> <span class="token string">"~bootstrap-sa../static/stylesheets/bootstrap/glyphicons"</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token keyword">@import</span> <span class="token string">"~bootstrap-sa../static/stylesheets/bootstrap/scaffolding"</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token keyword">@import</span> <span class="token string">"~bootstrap-sa../static/stylesheets/bootstrap/type"</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token keyword">@import</span> <span class="token string">"~bootstrap-sa../static/stylesheets/bootstrap/grid"</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token keyword">@import</span> <span class="token string">"~bootstrap-sa../static/stylesheets/bootstrap/forms"</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token keyword">@import</span> <span class="token string">"~bootstrap-sa../static/stylesheets/bootstrap/buttons"</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token keyword">@import</span> <span class="token string">"~bootstrap-sa../static/stylesheets/bootstrap/utilities"</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token keyword">@import</span> <span class="token string">"~bootstrap-sa../static/stylesheets/bootstrap/responsive-utilities"</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>I am using <a href="https://webpack.js.org">webpack</a> to parse the files.

You may have already spotted that I don\'t include any <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/">components that require Javascript</a> thus jQuery. I am not going to include Bootstrap\'s Javascript files either.</p>\n<p>Great, now let\'s write some HTML:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-html"><code><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>div</span> <span class="token attr-name">class</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>container posts-container<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n  <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>div</span> <span class="token attr-name">class</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>row posts-row<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>div</span> <span class="token attr-name">class</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>col-sm-6 col-md-3 posts-row__post<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n      <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>h1</span> <span class="token attr-name">class</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>post__title<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>Post title<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>h1</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>div</span> <span class="token attr-name">class</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>col-sm-6 col-md-3 posts-row__post<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n      <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>h1</span> <span class="token attr-name">class</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>post__title<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>Another blog post<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>h1</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n  <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Ok it works. But, there is a strong coupling with Bootstrap\'s grid system and our HTML code. Since Bootstrap is a CSS framework, only our CSS code should be dealing with it. This way I could remove Bootstrap in the future and only have to change my CSS code, not the HTML too.</p>\n<p>Let\'s rewrite:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-html"><code><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>div</span> <span class="token attr-name">class</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>posts-container<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n  <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>div</span> <span class="token attr-name">class</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>posts-row<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>div</span> <span class="token attr-name">class</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>posts-row__post<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n      <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>h1</span> <span class="token attr-name">class</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>post__title<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>Post title<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>h1</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>div</span> <span class="token attr-name">class</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>posts-row__post<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n      <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>h1</span> <span class="token attr-name">class</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>post__title<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>Another blog post<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>h1</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n  <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Yeap, much cleaner, readable and domain oriented. Now let\'s tie this together with Bootstrap:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-scss"><code><span class="token selector">.posts-container </span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n  <span class="token keyword">@extend</span> .container<span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span>\n\n<span class="token selector">.posts-row </span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n  <span class="token keyword">@include</span> <span class="token function">make-row</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span>\n\n<span class="token selector">.posts-row__post </span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n  <span class="token keyword">@include</span> <span class="token function">make-sm-column</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>6<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n  <span class="token keyword">@include</span> <span class="token function">make-md-column</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>3<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>We either extend a Bootstrap\'s class or using it\'s <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/mast../static/stylesheets/bootstrap/mixins/_grid.scss">mixins</a>.</p>\n<p>Now only our CSS knows about Bootstrap. HTML doesn\'t care. Bootstrap can be anyone of your favorite CSS frameworks.</p>\n<p>If I was about to switch to Flexbox for example, I would go like this:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-scss"><code><span class="token selector">.posts-row </span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n  <span class="token property">display</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> flex<span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n  <span class="token property">flex-wrap</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> wrap<span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span>\n\n<span class="token selector">.posts-row__post </span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n  <span class="token property">flex</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> 1 0 200px<span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n  <span class="token property">box-sizing</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> border-box<span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n  <span class="token property">padding</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> 10px<span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>This is how I always start a CSS codebase for a project. It helps me to create prototypes quickly and once the project hits a more mature stage, I could start rewriting and throwing away dependencies.</p>\n<p>To conclude, try to keep your codebase clean and not mixed-up. Have a vision in your mind of how it is going to evolve in the future. Once you have that, you can start thinking of you can ease the process in the future.</p>\n<p>Leave me a comment if you liked my approach on starting a new custom CSS framework.</p>',id:"/Users/Bariotis/Dev/develop/kostasbariotis.com/src/pages/writing-a-custom-css-framework/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:3,frontmatter:{date:"2017-04-04T09:40:42.000Z",path:"/writing-a-custom-css-framework/",tags:"CSS, Bootstrap",title:"Writing a custom CSS framework",draft:null}},{excerpt:"It all started when  Adonis  told me that he was looking to contribute to some open source projects.

It\'s hosted on a <a href="https://m.do.co/c/2b3d657e5315">DigitalOcean droplet</a>, uses a <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let\'s Encrypt</a> certificate, <a href="https://www.mailgun.com">Mailgun</a> for transactional emails and a MongoDB for persistent storage.</p>\n<p>It looks like this:</p>\n<p>\n          <a\n            class="gatsby-resp-image-link"\n            href="undefined"\n            style="display: block"\n            target="_blank"\n            rel="noopener"\n          >\n            <span\n              class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n              style="position: relative; z-index: -1; display: block; "\n            >\n              <span\n                class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n                style="padding-bottom: 12.254160363086234%;position: relative; width: 100%; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAACCAYAAABYBvyLAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAAjElEQVQI12P49OHrv29ff/wHYSC7ggEK3r766AgU+/Hh3eccmFhb8XLmyvRp7Oun3mSCib1782kRTP/XL98vMXz7/O333/cf/v959/7/9/efVjXlL2QH4RdP38T+/fzl//evP1tA/JqsWRylKRNFQIZUZc7gh4jNZP/08eu8f7///P/z5t3/f//+/QcAWrhiUN6XL64AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n              >\n                <img\n                  class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n                  style="width: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n                  alt=""\n                  title=""\n                  src="/static/56cb14d1d599ba64fc46546d2ec6c754-34135.png"\n                  srcset="/static/56cb14d1d599ba64fc46546d2ec6c754-ec056.png 188w,\n/static/56cb14d1d599ba64fc46546d2ec6c754-44ccd.png 375w,\n/static/56cb14d1d599ba64fc46546d2ec6c754-34135.png 661w"\n                  sizes="(max-width: 661px) 100vw, 661px"\n                />\n              </span>\n            </span>\n          </a>\n          </p>\n<p>So the Front End app is responsible for gathering emails from the user and inserting them into MongoDB. The worker is continuously traversing the collection and checking them against GitHub to see if there is anything new. It\'s that simple!</p>\n<h2>Worker</h2>\n<p>At first, I thought a queue would be a good fit for this since I needed to keep the order that the documents were being created. I knew that the purpose of a queue was to keep the messages processing in order but only to be processed once. I wanted to keep processing the same messages over and over again. So I decided to go with the simplest way possible. Let\'s have a worker continuously fetching a collection over and over again.</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-js"><code><span class="token comment" spellcheck="true">/**\n * Main run function that handles the infinite\n * loop over the database\n */</span>\n<span class="token keyword">const</span> run <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>cursor<span class="token punctuation">,</span> worker<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n  <span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>cursor<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">isClosed</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n    cursor<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">rewind</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n  <span class="token punctuation">}</span>\n\n  <span class="token keyword">return</span> cursor\n    <span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">next</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>\n    <span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">then</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>subscription <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n      <span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token operator">!</span>subscription<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n        <span class="token keyword">throw</span> <span class="token keyword">new</span> <span class="token class-name">Error</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">\'Cursor got to the end\'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n      <span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token keyword">else</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n        <span class="token keyword">return</span> subscription<span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n      <span class="token punctuation">}</span>\n    <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>\n    <span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">then</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>subscription <span class="token operator">=></span> worker<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">run</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>subscription<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>\n    <span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token keyword">catch</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>error<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> logger<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">error</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>error<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>\n    <span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">then</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token function">setTimeout</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token function">run</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>cursor<span class="token punctuation">,</span> worker<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">0</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>By passing a <a href="https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/2.0/api/Cursor.html">MongoDB cursor object</a> and a function that you want to be called with every item, it keeps traversing the collection and gets updated even when a new item is being created. There is no need to restart the connection to MongoDB.</p>\n<p>The <code>setTimeout</code> ensures that the next call will get it\'s own call stack so we don\'t overflow the current one.</p>\n<p><a href="https://github.com/kbariotis/gityeller/blob/master/worker/index.js">Here\'s the complete</a> worker\'s source code.</p>\n<h2>Check against GitHub</h2>\n<p>Let\'s see how we are asking GitHub if it has something new to show us. The actual API call is this:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-none"><code>URL: api.github.com/owner/repo?labels=label</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>This will return us a list of issues labeled with that specific label of that repository.</p>\n<p>Once we make this request for the first time, we have a timestamp of the latest check. Next time, we will just query with that timestamp, in order to get only the issues that have been created between the last check and now (Actually GitHub returns those issues that have even been updated during that period, so <a href="https://github.com/kbariotis/gityeller/blob/master/worker/worker.js#L89">I have to make some extra checks</a>). Now the query looks like this:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-none"><code>URL: api.github.com/owner/repo?labels=label&since=LATEST_RESPONSE_DATE</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>GitHub\'s API has a limit. They allow you to do certain API calls in a certain amount of time. I wanted to minimize the calls as much possible because once I hit that limit I won\'t be able to take the results I wanted so the users will never get notified.</p>\n<p>Each time we are making this request, GitHub will count minus one requests of our available quota. In order to save some juice I am using <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/#conditional-requests">GitHub\'s conditional requests</a>. The above request will return us an ETag header with a value. We can use that value to validate whether our latest response is outdated or not. If it\'s not, GitHub will respond with a 304 Not Modified status code and an empty body.</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-none"><code>URL: api.github.com/owner/repo?labels=label&since=LATEST_RESPONSE_DATE\nHEADERS: If-None-Match: LATEST_RESPONSE_ETAG</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>This way the request won\'t be counted. We saved a request and we will only be charged if there is actually something new.</p>\n<p>Read more about <a href="https://bitworking.org/news/150/REST-Tip-Deep-etags-give-you-more-benefits">ETags and "conditional requests"</a>.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Certainly, the solution is not optimal. Once the collection grows bigger, the time between the checks for each individual item in the collection will also be long. But it was a fun weekend project. I am already watching the <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node">node.js</a> repo for new issues labeled <code>v7.x</code>.</p>\n<p>Which repo are you going to watch? Leave me a comment if you liked my weekend project.
