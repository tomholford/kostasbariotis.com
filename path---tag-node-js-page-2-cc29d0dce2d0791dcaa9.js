In this article I would like to talk about the mindset of adopting such an infrastructure and some key concepts you must keep in mind, especially when using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/\">AWS's SQS</a>, a cloud hosted Messaging System.</p>\n<p>Besides SQS, there is also, <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/\">Azure's Storage</a> and I am sure there are others as well. There are also <a href=\"http://queues.io/\">open source implementations</a> that you can host on your machines.</p>\n<h2>What's a QCW</h2>\n<p>A QCW is purely described by the separation of the Web Tier that generates requests and the Service Tier that processes them and it's a subset of the <a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html\">CQRS pattern</a>. Thus, loose coupling of the dependent services can be achieved.</p>\n<p>The essential part here is that we are going from a <em>direct response of the Server</em> model to a <em>I will process that later, continue with what you're doing</em> model, moving towards a Tasks Based workflow. It's a great candidate for time consuming processes or when the possibility of a system to be down is high and won't be able to service requests immediately. The <em>at-least-once delivery</em> of requests can be guaranteed.</p>\n<p>By Queue we are referring to a service that implements the standard data structure Queue and sits between a Producer and a Consumer. The Producers generates requests and puts them in the Queue via an <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/MakingRequestsArticle.html\">API</a>. The Consumer then reads the Queue and processes them. The communication is asynchronous which mean that the Producers won't get an immediate response from the requests that sends.  Instead the Consumer may then choose to somehow inform the Producer about the results. Either by sending an email to the admin or by sending a message through a WebSocket that can then be displayed directly to the user.</p>\n<h2>Why to use it</h2>\n<p>While there are a lot of problems such a workflow can solve, the most common one is that the processing part of our application can't handle eager clients that are sending requests too fast or send requests that will take too long to process.</p>\n<p>The Producers can send requests to the Consumer, through the Queue, as aggressively as he wants, but the Consumer will process them based on the current workload.</p>\n<p>By keeping Requests to a separate place we can also not worry about losing requests since the Consumer can go off and back online again and start processing requests from the point where he left them.</p>\n<p>There are many more gains but we found those to be the most essential problems we need to solve.</p>\n<h2>Consuming the Queue</h2>\n<p>A complex thing about consuming a Queue is that of the Consumer and the policy he follows for reading and processing messages. In general, the flow goes like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Get the next available message from the top of the Queue</li>\n<li>Process the message</li>\n<li>Delete the message</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It's essential to note that you need the message that is in the the top of the queue. Otherwise, you can't guarantee that all messages will be processed in the same time period. You need the <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO\">FIFO</a></strong> policy. Unfortunately, AWS SQS can't guarantee that for you, because of their distributed nature and you have to implement such functionality by your self.</p>\n<h3>Long Polling</h3>\n<p>In order to get new messages, you have to ask the Queue once in a while if it has any messages. That's <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/12855533/1955940\">Polling</a>. Several implementation provides some sort of Pushing mechanism that will directly notify a Consumer that there are pending messages to be processed. SQS doesn't support that, but they support <strong><a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-long-polling.html\">Long Polling</a></strong> which is actually when we ask the Queue for new messages and if there are none, the connection is being kept alive until there is one or till the connection times out. SQS supports up to 20 seconds of Long Polling. After that, we must re ask the Queue and wait another 20 seconds.</p>\n<h3>Visibility Timeout</h3>\n<p>While processing a message, a lot of things can go wrong that will make the process to fail. In such case, the message can't be deleted and must remain in the Queue in order to reprocess it. But if we leave it there, it's going to be returned over and over again and we can't be sure that is going to succeed the next time. Instead of deleting the message, the Queue can hide it for a specific period of time, so we can continue processing other messages and reprocess that message at some point in the future again. This is a <strong><a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/AboutVT.html\">Queue's Visibility Timeout</a></strong>.</p>\n<h3>Poisoned Messages</h3>\n<p>Still, this won't guarantee that the message will be processed successfully at any time. The message may be poisoned, that means that it failed passing our domain's model requirements and that it won't be processed unless we change our logic. Those are called <strong>Poison Messages</strong> and a policy must be specified that will take care of those. For example, a counter may be kept for each poisoned message and after the third time that it failed to be processed it must be deleted.</p>\n<h3>Dead Letter Queues</h3>\n<p>In case of such a failure, you don't want to bypass that without investigating the cause. You'll need to know what was the reason that marked the message as poisoned. Hopefully, instead of deleting it after the third attempt, you can store it in a <strong><a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/SQSDeadLetterQueue.html\">Dead Letter Queue</a></strong>. A Dead Letter Queue is simply another Queue that holds only the failed messages. Those can be messages that couldn't be processed or messages that couldn't be pushed in the Queue cause it's full or non responding. After you store them there, you can go back at any time and examine those messages and see what you have done wrong in the first place.</p>\n<h2>Finally</h2>\n<p>So we talked about what a QCW is, how it can be used and also for some key concepts of SQS such as Queue's Visibility Timeout, Polling, Poison Messages and Dead Letter Queues. AWS has a great <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/sqs/\">documentation on SQS</a>.</p>\n<p>Also, <a href=\"http://www.bennadel.com/index.cfm\">Ben Addel</a> has a nice implementation of a <a href=\"http://www.bennadel.com/blog/2792-shedding-the-monolithic-application-with-aws-simple-queue-service-sqs-and-node-js.htm\">Nodejs SQS Consumer</a> that uses Promises to do Long Polling. It is basic, without handling Poison Messages or using Dead Letter Queues and it's a great starting point.</p>\n<p>I've also found the Queue Centric Workflow chapter of the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Cloud-Architecture-Patterns-Using-Microsoft/dp/1449319777\">Cloud Architecture Patterns</a> books to have some excellent resources.</p>\n<p>If you have any previous experience in any of the subjects talked above, please share it in the comments.

And that creates a problem and a lot of side effects.</p>\n<p>To avoid this common pitfall we create immutable objects, those that no one can change during the app\'s lifecycle. By default, all Javascript types, except objects, define immutable values.</p>\n<p>Have you ever tried to alter an object, say to delete a property, but you couldn\'t? Say to delete a Mongoose document\'s property? Mongoose documents are immutable and their properties can\'t be alter in any way, except of altering their actual values that they\'re holding.</p>\n<h3>Cloning objects in Javascript</h3>\n<p>So what do we do when we need to alter them?

This way we can be sure that a developer can\'t mess with our code or hide from them info about our structures that they don\'t have to know about. <strong><code>defineProperty</code> won\'t throw an error while you\'re trying to alter the object\'s properties and this can really be a PITA.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty">Object.freeze()</a> / <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/seal">Object.seal()</a>\n<code>freeze</code> and <code>seal</code> are basically shorthands for the <code>defineProperty</code> and can both come in handy. Make sure that their compatibility tables meet your needs before you use them. <strong>Will throw an error and will save you hours of frustration.</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>The End</h2>\n<p>Next time you are writing a Javascript module and you are exposing objects that other developers may use, make sure that they have the exact needed permissions to alter your objects, otherwise they may broke your code without even realising it.

The first time you install a Node.js dependency by  , the latest version of that package, will be installed along with the npm's...",html:"<p>A common pitfall when comes to development teams is the inconsistent software and library versions across developers.</p>\n<p>The first time you install a Node.js dependency by <code>npm install --save</code>, the latest version of that package, will be installed along with the npm's default <a href=\"https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/config#save-prefix\">save prefix (^)</a>. The '^' allows npm to auto install minor upgrades for this package, according to the <a href=\"http://semver.org/\">semver schema</a>.</p>\n<p>Because of that, it's hard to guarantee that every developer in the team will have the same version and this creates problems. It can really save your day, when two different people on the same codebase gets different results on an predefined procedure and the cause is a breaking change on a package that got updated.</p>\n<p>So what we do? There are a few ways you can pass this:</p>\n<h3>Reset the default <code>--save-prefix</code>.</h3>\n<p>By running <code>npm config set save-prefix=''</code> you're overriding npm's default <a href=\"https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/config#save-prefix\">save-prefix</a> value which is <code>^</code>. Now every package you install will be locked on it's current version and every person that runs <code>npm install</code> will get that version.</p>\n<p>This can also introduce outdated packages, so make sure that you keep an eye on your dependencies for critical updates that you don't want to miss. You can also take advantage of the npm's <a href=\"https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/outdated\">outdated command</a> that will check every package and report back for outdated packages.</p>\n<p>Consider also keeping this setting in your <a href=\"https://docs.npmjs.com/files/npmrc\"><code>.npmrc</code></a> file, to not force every developer to set it explicitly on his/her machine.</p>\n<h3>shrinkwrap</h3>\n<p>npm's <a href=\"https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/shrinkwrap\">shrinkwrap</a> is also a handy way to lock your versions across your team. By running <code>npm shrinkwrap</code>, a <code>shrinkwrap.json</code> file will be created at the root of your repo with the current versions  of your dependencies that are install at the moment and their dependencies.</p>\n<p>With <code>shrinkwrap</code> you get the exact same dependencies tree across and not worry about breaking updates. <code>npm install</code> will respect a <code>shrinkwrap.json</code> file if it finds but it must also agrees with the current <code>package.json</code> file, so expect errors if those two files are not align.</p>\n<p><code>shinkwrap</code> is the most safe way of locking your dependencies versions and still keeping them out of your repo, which brings me to the third and final option.</p>\n<h3>Keep Your Dependencies Under Version Control</h3>\n<p>This method is widely used, especially when maximum security is required. It's a proven method that keeps not only locked versions but code content too, so you don't worry if a malicious piece of code find it's way inside your favorite open source dependencies.</p>\n<p>Be careful though, cause your repo will increase in size really quick. In case of a dependency that needs to be compiled (e.g. by <a href=\"https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp\">node-gyp</a>) the source code is usually really big, so be careful on that.</p>\n<p>The npm guys have also a <a href=\"https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/shrinkwrap#caveats\">few words</a> on this.</p>\n<h2>Not a Node.js Fan</h2>\n<p>In case that you aren't really into Node.js but you still reading this piece (big ups man!!), I shall inform you that these techniques aren't new either have been introduced by the Node.js community for the first time.</p>\n<p>PHP's Composer keeps a <a href=\"https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#composer-lock-the-lock-file\">composer.lock</a> file that locks the current installed versions and Ruby's Bundler has a Gemfile.lock file. Same goes for other systems.</p>\n<p>So, do your homework and find your PM's way of handling this kind of life saver functionality.</p>\n<h2>A Final Word</h2>\n<p>Dependencies of a codebase is an every day process and can easily lead to few hours of bug hunting. Make sure to save those hours.</p>\n<p>But, sooner or later, your team's inner policies will fail and this is ok, as soon as you understand the causes, you fix them and move. Move faster every time.

You want your errors to be identical everywhere, to provide not too much information for your internal system but enough information to the debugger.</p>\n<p>I am a REST fan and I hope you are too. What basically REST tell us, is to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes">HTTP\'s error codes</a> for our API responses. E.g. when the user requests a particular row from our DB, using an identifier, and that row doesn\'t exists we should respond with a <code>404 Not Found</code> status code.</p>\n<p>Express.js has a <a href="http://expressjs.com/guide/error-handling.html">default error handler</a>. Basicaly it\'s just a middleware, with an extra argument, the <code>err</code> argument.</p>\n<p>On an Express.js request lifecycle, when an error occurs, we pass on to the next middleware with populated error variable, and the error handler triggers.</p>\n<p>Let\'s start with that.</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-js"><code>router<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">use</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>err<span class="token punctuation">,</span> req<span class="token punctuation">,</span> res<span class="token punctuation">,</span> next<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n\t<span class="token comment" spellcheck="true">/* We log the error internaly */</span>\n    logger<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">error</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>err<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n\n\t<span class="token comment" spellcheck="true">/*\n     * Remove Error\'s `stack` property.

Logging the error and proper displaying it. So I am logging it using a <a href="https://github.com/winstonjs/winston">logger</a> module and passing it to the user, using the error\'s status code. I have predefined those status codes so I don\'t have to deal with them every time. How? Let\'s see.</p>\n<p>An error often consists of more than just an error code. We need a title, little more information and the stack trace on development environment. Instead of dealing with those information every time we create objects and only changing the bits we want each time. Here\'s a <code>Not Found</code> error object.</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-js"><code>module<span class="token punctuation">.</span>exports <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token function">notFound</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>message<span class="token punctuation">,</span> errorCode<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n\n  Error<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">captureStackTrace</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token keyword">this</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token keyword">this</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>constructor<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n\n  <span class="token keyword">this</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>name <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">this</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>constructor<span class="token punctuation">.</span>name<span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n  <span class="token keyword">this</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>message <span class="token operator">=</span> message <span class="token operator">||</span> <span class="token string">\'The requested resource couldn\\\'t be found\'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n  <span class="token keyword">this</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>statusCode <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">404</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n  <span class="token keyword">this</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>errorCode <span class="token operator">=</span> errorCode <span class="token operator">||</span> <span class="token number">404</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>We are inheriting the Node.js <code>Error</code> class and create a generic <code>Not Found</code> error object we can use every time we need one.</p>\n<p>So now we need to pass this to the Express.js error handler. So on an ordinary controller we do:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-js"><code>app<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">use</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">\'/customers/:id\'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>req<span class="token punctuation">,</span> res<span class="token punctuation">,</span> next<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n\n\t<span class="token keyword">var</span> id <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">properSanitization</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>req<span class="token punctuation">.</span>params<span class="token punctuation">.</span>id<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n\n\tsomeDBDriver<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">findOne</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>id<span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>model<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n    \t<span class="token keyword">if</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token operator">!</span>model<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n        \t<span class="token function">next</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token keyword">new</span> <span class="token class-name">NotFound</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">\'Entity with id: \'</span> <span class="token operator">+</span> id <span class="token operator">+</span> <span class="token string">\' couldn\\\'t be bound.\'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n        <span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token keyword">else</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n        \t<span class="token comment" spellcheck="true">/* ... */</span>\n        <span class="token punctuation">}</span>\n    <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>So now the error handler will take place and do it\'s magic.</p>\n<p>Often, in a more complex API will need more expressive status codes to express it\'s disfunctionalities. In that case, you can still respond with the proper status code but keep an internal error eode that makes sense on your application. So, in case a user tries to login with wrong credentials, send a 401 to the API consumer but keep an internal code, e.g. 4001 that means <strong>"Wrong Username/Password"</strong>. And that\'s what the <code>errorCode</code> is.</p>\n<p>Here\'s a simple <a href="http://github.com/kbariotis/throw.js">error collection</a> i\'ve wrote, to save you the hassle.
