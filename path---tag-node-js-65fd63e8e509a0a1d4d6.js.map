How they have evolved and why I switched from a <a href=\\\"https://ghost.org\\\">Ghost</a> powered site to <a href=\\\"https://gatsbyjs.org\\\">Gatsby.js</a>, a modern static site generator.</p>\\n<h2>Static site generators as we know them</h2>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://jekyllrb.com\\\">Jekyll</a>, <a href=\\\"https://hexo.io\\\">Hexo</a>, <a href=\\\"https://gohugo.io/\\\">Hugo</a>. They do one thing and they do it well. I've built a ton of sites using Jekyll hosted either on GitHub either somewhere else. They all work pretty much the same way:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>You describe your content in some common templating language (<a href=\\\"pugjs.org\\\">Pug</a>, <a href=\\\"http://handlebarsjs.com\\\">Handlebars</a>, etc)</li>\\n<li>While in development, start a local web server and add file \\\"watchers\\\" that will listen for content changes and re-render the site</li>\\n<li>Finally, you render the whole site in static HTML and deploy. The generator will combine your files and produce a well formed HTML content.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>A caveat here is that you have to keep the client side logic separated from the backend. Much like in an architecture where Wordpress is involved. So, pretty much nothing is changing. The difference from having a cached version of Wordpress and content generated with Jekyll is none.</p>\\n<h2>Enter the new world order</h2>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react/\\\">React.js</a>! Awww yeah! We've heard about it! It's dominating the Web, but for a reason. There are so many reasons React.js have gained such a hype. Many of the techniques we will discuss here can be easily applied to other frameworks and libraries but React.js can play so nicely with them.</p>\\n<p>There is this function called <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-dom-server.html\\\">Server Side Rendering</a> where you can produce static HTML content directly from a tree of React.js components. That HTML content will contain the required React.js specific annotations so when the same tree will be loaded on the client, on top of the previously produced content, will know exactly what has to be rendered and what not to. From there, the client side logic can take the lead. Once the user visits a site, the server will respond with the static HTML. Once it's loaded in the user's browser and the user navigates in another route, the client side logic will respond and will render the new page, instead of contacting the server again. The same codebase will be used for the backend as also for the frontend. And that's a game changer.</p>\\n<p>So let's see the new list:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Describe your content in React.js Components</li>\\n<li>On development time, write code like a boss (hot reloading, modularized code, webpack plugins, etc...)</li>\\n<li>Use React.js SSR API to produce the static content to be served on the backend, as well as the frontend side assets to be used on the visitor's browser</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Wait, what? Like that?</h2>\\n<p>Yeah, I know. I made it look so easy. It's not. There is the need for a strong abstraction that will track your links across your components, parse content written in another format, like blog posts written in Markdown, generate code that will not bloat the client and will efficiently serve the content to the user.</p>\\n<p>Thankfully, there are a few projects that took the initiative and they are doing a great job so far. At the time of reading this, this site will already be served by GitHub pages and the content you will see once you view the source it's been generated by <a href=\\\"https://gatsbyjs.org\\\">Gatsby.js</a>.</p>\\n<p>I have been following those projects for quite a while. Here's my list:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://gatsbyjs.org\\\">Gatsby.js</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://phenomic.io\\\">Phenomic</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://nextein.now.sh\\\">nextein</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>At the time that I started following them, all of them were in a very early stage and none of them could generate my site's content the way I wanted and in the same way as my previous one so to not lose paths and certain functionalities. I wanted to make the generated site, exactly like the old one in terms of the user experience. Once Gatsby.js hit major version 1, I started using it and the result..., you are looking at it!</p>\\n<h2>What exactly am I looking at?</h2>\\n<p>First, if you navigate around my site, you will notice that the browser doesn't fully re-renders the site. Gatsby will generate a JSON file for each route, so the browser can request only that file and React.js will render only the appropriate components. (Previously, I was using a technique called <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com__ghost-theme/blob/master/src/js/app.js#L11\\\">pjax</a> to create the same effect. While it looked the same, it was more hack-ish.)</p>\\n<p>Second, you can take a look at the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com\\\">source code</a>. While you need some knowledge of how Gatsby works, let me give you a sense of how this site is being generated. You can find all my blog posts and the main pages(<code>/</code>, <code>/about</code>, <code>/drafts</code>) of this site at <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com/tree/master/src/pages\\\"><code>/src/pages</code></a>. Common components can be found at <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com/tree/master/src/components\\\"><code>/src/components</code></a>. At <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com/tree/master/gatsby-node.js\\\"><code>/gatsby-node.js</code></a> you can find the route it takes in order to render the site. First, it loads all posts using the GraphQL api which queries all <code>.md</code> files. Then it creates a page for each one, using the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com/tree/master/src/templates/blog-post.js\\\"><code>/src/templates/blog-post.js</code></a> template and before that it creates a page, with pagination, for all posts and tags again using the appropriate template file.</p>\\n<p>On development, Gatsby will generate all of these in memory and fire up a development server that I can use to preview my site.</p>\\n<p>You can try it your self by cloning the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com\\\">source code</a> and after installing dependencies, hit:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>npm run develop</code> to fire up the development server</li>\\n<li><code>npm run build</code> to build the site (check the <code>/public</code> folder after its done)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>An alternative to HTML caching</h2>\\n<p>Static site generation can be seen as another form of caching your content. Think of when you are caching the home page of a Wordpress powered site and you are serving the cached content to every visitor. The thing though is that in many cases, there is no need for a system like Wordpress at all.</p>\\n<p>My personal site contains a list of blog posts and static information about me that I am updating it once in a while. Comments are being hosted on <a href=\\\"https://disqus.com\\\">Disqus</a>. There is absolutely no need for a system like Wordpress or even a system like <a href=\\\"https://ghost.org\\\">Ghost</a> which I have been using for the last 3 years. While it served me well all this time, I really got tired of updating it, ssh-ing to the server, doing migrations and doing other ops required by such a stack. While there are also options for hosting in the cloud, pretty much they will be paid and fairly enough, they deserve it for doing such a job.</p>\\n<p>But do I need a system like that? Not at all. And while we all know how much important that Wordpress' Admin UI is to maintain our content, I would argue that we can separate the backend from the frontend and have lots of new features built in automatically. Imagine that instead of having <a href=\\\"https://memcached.org/\\\">memcached</a> caching your HTML in front of your WordPress site, you trigger a hook each time your database changes that will re-generate the frontend using <a href=\\\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-wordpress/\\\">Gatsby</a>. Yes, Gatsby supports multiple backend sources to load your content. Instead of storing them inside your VCS like me, you can as well load them from your Wordpress's MySQL database.</p>\\n<p>To conclude, modern static generators will allow us to:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>serve static content without maintaining complex stacks</li>\\n<li>keep a clear separation between the backend and the frontend</li>\\n<li>have cool features like client side routing and hot reload on development, out of the box</li>\\n<li>reuse the same code that is being used to generate the backend content at our visitors' browsers</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Hope that you will experiment with Gatsby and you will let me know what you think.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/Bariotis/Dev/develop/kostasbariotis.com/src/pages/modern-static-site-generation/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"timeToRead\":6,\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"2017-08-18T00:00:00.000Z\",\"path\":\"/modern-static-site-generation/\",\"tags\":\"node.js, reactjs, javascript\",\"title\":\"Modern static site generation\",\"draft\":null}},{\"excerpt\":\"It all started when  Adonis  told me that he was looking to contribute to some open source projects.

He had a list of projects that he actively uses but he didn't want to always be checking their issues list for new issues that he could get his hands on. So we thought it would be cool if we had a way to watch a GitHub repository for issues of specific tags, e.g. \\\"Need help\\\", \\\"Good first contribution\\\", etc.</p>\\n<p>I thought that's something I could easily hack in a weekend.

The worker is continuously traversing the collection and checking them against GitHub to see if there is anything new. It's that simple!</p>\\n<h2>Worker</h2>\\n<p>At first, I thought a queue would be a good fit for this since I needed to keep the order that the documents were being created. I knew that the purpose of a queue was to keep the messages processing in order but only to be processed once. I wanted to keep processing the same messages over and over again. So I decided to go with the simplest way possible. Let's have a worker continuously fetching a collection over and over again.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token comment\\\"

and gets updated even when a new item is being created. There is no need to restart the connection to MongoDB.</p>\\n<p>The <code>setTimeout</code> ensures that the next call will get it's own call stack so we don't overflow the current one.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/gityeller/blob/master/worker/index.js\\\">Here's the complete</a> worker's source code.</p>\\n<h2>Check against GitHub</h2>\\n<p>Let's see how we are asking GitHub if it has something new to show us. The actual API call is this:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>URL: api.github.com/owner/repo?labels=label</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>This will return us a list of issues labeled with that specific label of that repository.</p>\\n<p>Once we make this request for the first time, we have a timestamp of the latest check. Next time, we will just query with that timestamp, in order to get only the issues that have been created between the last check and now (Actually GitHub returns those issues that have even been updated during that period, so <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/gityeller/blob/master/worker/worker.js#L89\\\">I have to make some extra checks</a>). Now the query looks like this:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>URL: api.github.com/owner/repo?labels=label&since=LATEST_RESPONSE_DATE</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>GitHub's API has a limit. They allow you to do certain API calls in a certain amount of time. I wanted to minimize the calls as much possible because once I hit that limit I won't be able to take the results I wanted so the users will never get notified.</p>\\n<p>Each time we are making this request, GitHub will count minus one requests of our available quota. In order to save some juice I am using <a href=\\\"https://developer.github.com/v3/#conditional-requests\\\">GitHub's conditional requests</a>. The above request will return us an ETag header with a value. We can use that value to validate whether our latest response is outdated or not. If it's not, GitHub will respond with a 304 Not Modified status code and an empty body.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>URL: api.github.com/owner/repo?labels=label&since=LATEST_RESPONSE_DATE\\nHEADERS: If-None-Match: LATEST_RESPONSE_ETAG</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>This way the request won't be counted. We saved a request and we will only be charged if there is actually something new.</p>\\n<p>Read more about <a href=\\\"https://bitworking.org/news/150/REST-Tip-Deep-etags-give-you-more-benefits\\\">ETags and \\\"conditional requests\\\"</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n<p>Certainly, the solution is not optimal. Once the collection grows bigger, the time between the checks for each individual item in the collection will also be long. But it was a fun weekend project.

Code evolves along with our Schema so keeping changes tracked is quite a necessity</li>\\n<li>Data integrity after updates</li>\\n<li>Rollbacks are our safety net of broken deployments. You can’t rollback your app when your data will be out of order.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Shorter release cycles often require database changes. Having those changes under version control allows us to make changes safely and in a more consistent way. A crucial part of following such methodologies is the evolutionary design which can help us keep track of how the database evolved along with our application. That way our data can rollback at any point of the history hand in hand with our app.</p>\\n<p>Evolving our database design along with our core functioning data during the application development, and doing that in a seamless way, requires the use of more sophisticated processes like Database migrations, which essentially are the management of incremental, reversible changes to our databases.</p>\\n<p>Database migrations are all about treating our database as another piece of code while applying core principles of Continuous Integration. Publishing new features along with the database changes, without requiring manual Ops work and removing any hands-on session from the DB is the way to move forward and create robust apps.</p>\\n<p>This article will walk you through the different types of migrations, how they are being used and how to write DB migrations in a Nodejs environment.</p>\\n<p>Let's explore the types of database migrations.</p>\\n<h2>Types of Migrations</h2>\\n<p>Database migrations usually have two forms. Both of those forms are usually required in a long-running project.</p>\\n<h3>Altering schema</h3>\\n<p>One of them is when we are in need of changing the database's schema. For example, when we add an Index, removing/adding a field or restructuring the current fields, moving one from being a String into an Integer.\\nThis could also mean that we may need to restructure the data that is already in the database, which brings us to the second form of migrations.</p>\\n<h3>Migrating data</h3>\\n<p>In a production environment, where data is already in the DB, we may have to migrate those as well. Same cases apply to testing and staging environments but production is a more fragile universe where mistakes are not forgiven.  Say we need to split the <code>Name</code> field of our Users table into a <code>First/Last Name</code> fields combination. One approach would be to create a field called <code>Last Name</code>. Traverse the table, split the <code>Name</code> into two chunks and move the latter to the newly created field. Finally, rename the <code>Name</code> field into <code>First Name</code>. This is a case of data migrations.</p>\\n<p>But how do we handle this without putting our hands in the DB?</p>\\n<h2>Automation is the key</h2>\\n<p>We must be able to describe our database and the migrations with code. This will allow us to store them into our VCS and run them on demand and in an autonomous way.</p>\\n<h2>SQL vs NoSQL</h2>\\n<p>As we know, SQL and NoSQL have some core differences but that also doesn't mean that we can omit migrations in any of them. SQL structure is strictly defined and both data and schema changes can be safely done using migrations. NoSQL, on the other hand, may not need that much of a schema change, due to their elasticity in that subject, but will definitely need data migrations.</p>\\n<h2>Database?</h2>\\n<p>Modern apps don't necessarily handle data or talk to a database directly. E.g., in a Microservices environment, applications may rely on other applications to hold their data and communicate with them through a REST API. That's ok because migrations may still need to run. But instead of interacting directly with a database, you have to use the API to make your changes.</p>\\n<h2>Migrations dive with Nodejs</h2>\\n<p>Applications built with Nodejs have no differences from any other stack.</p>\\n<p>After doing a little research, I ended up using <a href=\\\"https://github.com/sequelize/umzug\\\">umzug</a> which provides a nice programmatic API to make your migrations. It's not opinionated at all and it doesn't provide any helper functions to make your actual migrations. It's just a library that will store what migrations have run. Which is actually what I need. If you need a more powerful thing you may want to take a look at <a href=\\\"https://github.com/db-migrate/node-db-migrate\\\">db-migrate</a>, which provides adapters for major databases and it will help you make changes to those in a more intuitive way.</p>\\n<p>Migration systems are providing a few standard things in order to make your migrations. Let's see those using Node.js:</p>\\n<h3>Write a migration</h3>\\n<p>Usually, we want to define two standard methods for a migration script. The function to run when we are migrating and the function when we are rolling back:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token string\\\">'use strict'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">var</span> Promise <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">require</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">'bluebird'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\nmodule<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>exports <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  up<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">new</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\">Promise</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>resolve<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> reject<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token comment\\\" spellcheck=\\\"true\\\">/* Here we write our migration function */</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n\\n  down<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">new</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\">Promise</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>resolve<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> reject<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token comment\\\" spellcheck=\\\"true\\\">/* This runs if we decide to rollback.

For that matter, we should choose our naming strategy wisely before implementation. I have chosen to give them a separate versioning, e.g. 1.0.js, 1.1.js or we could give them the issue ID of our PM that refers to the particular requirement. The choice is yours. Just be consistent.</p>\\n<h3>Keep track of the migrations that have already been executed</h3>\\n<p>At any given moment, we must be able to tell what migrations have been executed and which migration needs to run next if there is one to run.\\nThis allows us to know the state of our database.</p>\\n<p>Umzug can use Sequelize to store the history of the migration into MySQL. <a href=\\\"https://github.com/sequelize/umzug#custom\\\">But with no hassle at all, we can write our own Adaptor to store them wherever we want</a>.</p>\\n<h3>Run a migration or run all migrations</h3>\\n<p>We have to be able to run a specific migration or run all migrations we have written. Those must run in order because usually some of them depend on others.\\nE.g. on a fresh environment we must run all migrations in order to bring the newly created database to its current state, as it currently lies in production.</p>\\n<p>To run all migrations:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code>umzug<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">up</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">then</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">...</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>or to run up to a particular migration:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code>umzug<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">up</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span> to<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'migration-filename'</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">then</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">...</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h3>Rollback a migration</h3>\\n<p>When defining one particular migration we are describing changes that will be applied to the database. Those changes must be reversible and that is why we must also describe the reverse action of that migration.\\nIn case we need to rollback our application back in a previous state that also introduced database changes, those changes must be revert as well in order for the application to continue operating like it used to do.</p>\\n<p>Just like <code>up</code>, but running <code>down</code> instead:\\nTo revert all migrations:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code>umzug<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">down</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">then</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">...</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>or to revert down to a particular migration:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code>umzug<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">down</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span> to<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'migration-filename'</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">then</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">...</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h3>Automating</h3>\\n<p>umzug doesn't come with a CLI out of the box, but it doesn't take much to write one yourself.\\nAfter I wrote mine, it's just a matter of:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-bash\\\"><code>node scripts/migrate\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>to run all migrations in fresh environments.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-bash\\\"><code>node scripts/migrate <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">[</span>up<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">|</span>down<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">]</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>version<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>to go to that particular migration. This will run on every instance of our application at boot time, so if there is a pending migration, it will run it.</p>\\n<h2>In conclusion</h2>\\n<p>Database manipulation should be part of our development process. There could be heavy changes where a developer couldn't handle and a DBA should come, but for rapid changes, migrations will serve us right, especially when we seeking for faster release cycles and keeping track of our Database changes.</p>\\n<p>I am sure that your system handles migration somehow, search it up if you have never thought of it.</p>\\n<p>In case you are already doing migrations, what is your preferred workflow?

I explained the concept of TDD and described my tools of choice for integrating the TDD flow with Node.js. It was great.</p>\\n<p>I didn't got into GUI testing and I saw a major interest on that. So I decided to take a look at the current state of GUI testing. Here are the main tools that I came up with:</p>\\n<h2>Zombie.js</h2>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://zombie.js.org/\\\">Zombie</a> uses <a href=\\\"https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom\\\">jsdom</a> to parse the required HTML and Javascript and then simulate the desired behaviour. I find it a great tool for testing basic functionality in small apps.</p>\\n<p>JSDom will create an in memory representation of the DOM and execute any Javascript dependencies so you can do a real testing scenario. Since it doesn't uses a real browser engine you can't find abnormalities of real world situations. So you can't rely on it for cross browser compatibility.</p>\\n<p>I got very frustrated while trying to test AJAX powered pages. For SPA apps, Zombie wouldn't be an ideal solution.</p>\\n<h2>Casper.js</h2>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://casperjs.org/\\\">Casper</a> on the other hand, is a wrapper around <a href=\\\"http://phantomjs.org/\\\">Phantom.js</a> which utilises a <a href=\\\"https://webkit.org/\\\">Webkit</a> headless browser and will do a full rendering of your web page in order to test it. Since you will have a full representation of your site you can even <a href=\\\"https://github.com/sindresorhus/pageres\\\">take screenshots for easier QA</a>.</p>\\n<p>Casper.js has neat documentation and it's API is really easy to follow and adopt.</p>\\n<h2>Nightwatch.js</h2>\\n<p>Now, on the heavy side, we have <a href=\\\"http://www.seleniumhq.org/\\\">Selenium</a>. Selenium is a set of projects. It started off by auto running browsers and injecting code into them so we can test it. Since then, browsers vendors kept evolving and expose a full set of control over their browsers so Selenium has native support over those, with the <a href=\\\"http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/\\\">Selenium WebDriver</a>.</p>\\n<p>You will have to install all the browsers you need to test locally and then use Selenium to run tests on them. It's pretty basic.</p>\\n<p>Selenium's internals and configuration is a bit overcomplicated and if you don't need it, you don't have to get into it. <a href=\\\"http://nightwatchjs.org/\\\">Nightwatch</a> is a great layer of abstraction on top of Selenium that will do all the heavy work for you.</p>\\n<h1>At the end</h1>\\n<p>I am sure there are tone of other solutions out there. Although, you will have to do a research on your own before starting your GUI testing journey, at then end just pick one and start.</p>\\n<p>Are you using something already?

How they have evolved and why I switched from a <a href=\\\"https://ghost.org\\\">Ghost</a> powered site to <a href=\\\"https://gatsbyjs.org\\\">Gatsby.js</a>, a modern static site generator.</p>\\n<h2>Static site generators as we know them</h2>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://jekyllrb.com\\\">Jekyll</a>, <a href=\\\"https://hexo.io\\\">Hexo</a>, <a href=\\\"https://gohugo.io/\\\">Hugo</a>. They do one thing and they do it well. I've built a ton of sites using Jekyll hosted either on GitHub either somewhere else. They all work pretty much the same way:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>You describe your content in some common templating language (<a href=\\\"pugjs.org\\\">Pug</a>, <a href=\\\"http://handlebarsjs.com\\\">Handlebars</a>, etc)</li>\\n<li>While in development, start a local web server and add file \\\"watchers\\\" that will listen for content changes and re-render the site</li>\\n<li>Finally, you render the whole site in static HTML and deploy. The generator will combine your files and produce a well formed HTML content.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>A caveat here is that you have to keep the client side logic separated from the backend. Much like in an architecture where Wordpress is involved. So, pretty much nothing is changing. The difference from having a cached version of Wordpress and content generated with Jekyll is none.</p>\\n<h2>Enter the new world order</h2>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react/\\\">React.js</a>! Awww yeah! We've heard about it! It's dominating the Web, but for a reason. There are so many reasons React.js have gained such a hype. Many of the techniques we will discuss here can be easily applied to other frameworks and libraries but React.js can play so nicely with them.</p>\\n<p>There is this function called <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-dom-server.html\\\">Server Side Rendering</a> where you can produce static HTML content directly from a tree of React.js components. That HTML content will contain the required React.js specific annotations so when the same tree will be loaded on the client, on top of the previously produced content, will know exactly what has to be rendered and what not to. From there, the client side logic can take the lead. Once the user visits a site, the server will respond with the static HTML. Once it's loaded in the user's browser and the user navigates in another route, the client side logic will respond and will render the new page, instead of contacting the server again. The same codebase will be used for the backend as also for the frontend. And that's a game changer.</p>\\n<p>So let's see the new list:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Describe your content in React.js Components</li>\\n<li>On development time, write code like a boss (hot reloading, modularized code, webpack plugins, etc...)</li>\\n<li>Use React.js SSR API to produce the static content to be served on the backend, as well as the frontend side assets to be used on the visitor's browser</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Wait, what? Like that?</h2>\\n<p>Yeah, I know. I made it look so easy. It's not. There is the need for a strong abstraction that will track your links across your components, parse content written in another format, like blog posts written in Markdown, generate code that will not bloat the client and will efficiently serve the content to the user.</p>\\n<p>Thankfully, there are a few projects that took the initiative and they are doing a great job so far. At the time of reading this, this site will already be served by GitHub pages and the content you will see once you view the source it's been generated by <a href=\\\"https://gatsbyjs.org\\\">Gatsby.js</a>.</p>\\n<p>I have been following those projects for quite a while. Here's my list:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://gatsbyjs.org\\\">Gatsby.js</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://phenomic.io\\\">Phenomic</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://nextein.now.sh\\\">nextein</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>At the time that I started following them, all of them were in a very early stage and none of them could generate my site's content the way I wanted and in the same way as my previous one so to not lose paths and certain functionalities. I wanted to make the generated site, exactly like the old one in terms of the user experience. Once Gatsby.js hit major version 1, I started using it and the result..., you are looking at it!</p>\\n<h2>What exactly am I looking at?</h2>\\n<p>First, if you navigate around my site, you will notice that the browser doesn't fully re-renders the site. Gatsby will generate a JSON file for each route, so the browser can request only that file and React.js will render only the appropriate components. (Previously, I was using a technique called <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com__ghost-theme/blob/master/src/js/app.js#L11\\\">pjax</a> to create the same effect. While it looked the same, it was more hack-ish.)</p>\\n<p>Second, you can take a look at the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com\\\">source code</a>. While you need some knowledge of how Gatsby works, let me give you a sense of how this site is being generated. You can find all my blog posts and the main pages(<code>/</code>, <code>/about</code>, <code>/drafts</code>) of this site at <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com/tree/master/src/pages\\\"><code>/src/pages</code></a>. Common components can be found at <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com/tree/master/src/components\\\"><code>/src/components</code></a>. At <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com/tree/master/gatsby-node.js\\\"><code>/gatsby-node.js</code></a> you can find the route it takes in order to render the site. First, it loads all posts using the GraphQL api which queries all <code>.md</code> files. Then it creates a page for each one, using the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com/tree/master/src/templates/blog-post.js\\\"><code>/src/templates/blog-post.js</code></a> template and before that it creates a page, with pagination, for all posts and tags again using the appropriate template file.</p>\\n<p>On development, Gatsby will generate all of these in memory and fire up a development server that I can use to preview my site.</p>\\n<p>You can try it your self by cloning the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com\\\">source code</a> and after installing dependencies, hit:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>npm run develop</code> to fire up the development server</li>\\n<li><code>npm run build</code> to build the site (check the <code>/public</code> folder after its done)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>An alternative to HTML caching</h2>\\n<p>Static site generation can be seen as another form of caching your content. Think of when you are caching the home page of a Wordpress powered site and you are serving the cached content to every visitor. The thing though is that in many cases, there is no need for a system like Wordpress at all.</p>\\n<p>My personal site contains a list of blog posts and static information about me that I am updating it once in a while. Comments are being hosted on <a href=\\\"https://disqus.com\\\">Disqus</a>. There is absolutely no need for a system like Wordpress or even a system like <a href=\\\"https://ghost.org\\\">Ghost</a> which I have been using for the last 3 years. While it served me well all this time, I really got tired of updating it, ssh-ing to the server, doing migrations and doing other ops required by such a stack. While there are also options for hosting in the cloud, pretty much they will be paid and fairly enough, they deserve it for doing such a job.</p>\\n<p>But do I need a system like that? Not at all. And while we all know how much important that Wordpress' Admin UI is to maintain our content, I would argue that we can separate the backend from the frontend and have lots of new features built in automatically. Imagine that instead of having <a href=\\\"https://memcached.org/\\\">memcached</a> caching your HTML in front of your WordPress site, you trigger a hook each time your database changes that will re-generate the frontend using <a href=\\\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-wordpress/\\\">Gatsby</a>. Yes, Gatsby supports multiple backend sources to load your content. Instead of storing them inside your VCS like me, you can as well load them from your Wordpress's MySQL database.</p>\\n<p>To conclude, modern static generators will allow us to:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>serve static content without maintaining complex stacks</li>\\n<li>keep a clear separation between the backend and the frontend</li>\\n<li>have cool features like client side routing and hot reload on development, out of the box</li>\\n<li>reuse the same code that is being used to generate the backend content at our visitors' browsers</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Hope that you will experiment with Gatsby and you will let me know what you think.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/Bariotis/Dev/develop/kostasbariotis.com/src/pages/modern-static-site-generation/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"timeToRead\":6,\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"2017-08-18T00:00:00.000Z\",\"path\":\"/modern-static-site-generation/\",\"tags\":\"node.js, reactjs, javascript\",\"title\":\"Modern static site generation\",\"draft\":null}},{\"excerpt\":\"It all started when  Adonis  told me that he was looking to contribute to some open source projects.

He had a list of projects that he actively uses but he didn't want to always be checking their issues list for new issues that he could get his hands on.

The worker is continuously traversing the collection and checking them against GitHub to see if there is anything new. It's that simple!</p>\\n<h2>Worker</h2>\\n<p>At first, I thought a queue would be a good fit for this since I needed to keep the order that the documents were being created. I knew that the purpose of a queue was to keep the messages processing in order but only to be processed once. I wanted to keep processing the same messages over and over again. So I decided to go with the simplest way possible. Let's have a worker continuously fetching a collection over and over again.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token comment\\\"

and gets updated even when a new item is being created. There is no need to restart the connection to MongoDB.</p>\\n<p>The <code>setTimeout</code> ensures that the next call will get it's own call stack so we don't overflow the current one.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/gityeller/blob/master/worker/index.js\\\">Here's the complete</a> worker's source code.</p>\\n<h2>Check against GitHub</h2>\\n<p>Let's see how we are asking GitHub if it has something new to show us. The actual API call is this:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>URL: api.github.com/owner/repo?labels=label</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>This will return us a list of issues labeled with that specific label of that repository.</p>\\n<p>Once we make this request for the first time, we have a timestamp of the latest check. Next time, we will just query with that timestamp, in order to get only the issues that have been created between the last check and now (Actually GitHub returns those issues that have even been updated during that period, so <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/gityeller/blob/master/worker/worker.js#L89\\\">I have to make some extra checks</a>). Now the query looks like this:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>URL: api.github.com/owner/repo?labels=label&since=LATEST_RESPONSE_DATE</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>GitHub's API has a limit. They allow you to do certain API calls in a certain amount of time. I wanted to minimize the calls as much possible because once I hit that limit I won't be able to take the results I wanted so the users will never get notified.</p>\\n<p>Each time we are making this request, GitHub will count minus one requests of our available quota. In order to save some juice I am using <a href=\\\"https://developer.github.com/v3/#conditional-requests\\\">GitHub's conditional requests</a>. The above request will return us an ETag header with a value. We can use that value to validate whether our latest response is outdated or not. If it's not, GitHub will respond with a 304 Not Modified status code and an empty body.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>URL: api.github.com/owner/repo?labels=label&since=LATEST_RESPONSE_DATE\\nHEADERS: If-None-Match: LATEST_RESPONSE_ETAG</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>This way the request won't be counted. We saved a request and we will only be charged if there is actually something new.</p>\\n<p>Read more about <a href=\\\"https://bitworking.org/news/150/REST-Tip-Deep-etags-give-you-more-benefits\\\">ETags and \\\"conditional requests\\\"</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n<p>Certainly, the solution is not optimal. Once the collection grows bigger, the time between the checks for each individual item in the collection will also be long. But it was a fun weekend project.

Databases change very often and contain data that can even disintegrate our whole application if they get out of sync. Changing a live database, whether it's related to schema or data, can be hard. Modern apps, where Agile methodologies along with processes such as <a href=\\\"http://continuousdelivery.com/\\\">Continuous Integration</a> apply, have raised the bar of complexity so maintaining a database separately from the application's business logic can be quite painful.</p>\\n<p>Fortunately, we have <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_migration\\\">Database Migrations</a>, a technique to help us keep our database changes under control.</p>\\n<h2>The problem</h2>\\n<p>Problems I have seen over the years:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Apps often need certain data to be in place in order to run. In a fresh environment, a team member may not have those or may need to import a subset of the production database.</li>\\n<li>Different instances of databases, such as production, stage, local environments, may get out of sync.</li>\\n<li>Multiple environments setups raise the complexity of different databases versions running at the same time</li>\\n<li>Continuous delivery needs repeatable and testable tasks</li>\\n<li>When a developer puts his/her hands in the DB, that change will be lost forever. Code evolves along with our Schema so keeping changes tracked is quite a necessity</li>\\n<li>Data integrity after updates</li>\\n<li>Rollbacks are our safety net of broken deployments. You can’t rollback your app when your data will be out of order.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Shorter release cycles often require database changes. Having those changes under version control allows us to make changes safely and in a more consistent way. A crucial part of following such methodologies is the evolutionary design which can help us keep track of how the database evolved along with our application. That way our data can rollback at any point of the history hand in hand with our app.</p>\\n<p>Evolving our database design along with our core functioning data during the application development, and doing that in a seamless way, requires the use of more sophisticated processes like Database migrations, which essentially are the management of incremental, reversible changes to our databases.</p>\\n<p>Database migrations are all about treating our database as another piece of code while applying core principles of Continuous Integration. Publishing new features along with the database changes, without requiring manual Ops work and removing any hands-on session from the DB is the way to move forward and create robust apps.</p>\\n<p>This article will walk you through the different types of migrations, how they are being used and how to write DB migrations in a Nodejs environment.</p>\\n<p>Let's explore the types of database migrations.</p>\\n<h2>Types of Migrations</h2>\\n<p>Database migrations usually have two forms. Both of those forms are usually required in a long-running project.</p>\\n<h3>Altering schema</h3>\\n<p>One of them is when we are in need of changing the database's schema. For example, when we add an Index, removing/adding a field or restructuring the current fields, moving one from being a String into an Integer.\\nThis could also mean that we may need to restructure the data that is already in the database, which brings us to the second form of migrations.</p>\\n<h3>Migrating data</h3>\\n<p>In a production environment, where data is already in the DB, we may have to migrate those as well. Same cases apply to testing and staging environments but production is a more fragile universe where mistakes are not forgiven.  Say we need to split the <code>Name</code> field of our Users table into a <code>First/Last Name</code> fields combination. One approach would be to create a field called <code>Last Name</code>. Traverse the table, split the <code>Name</code> into two chunks and move the latter to the newly created field. Finally, rename the <code>Name</code> field into <code>First Name</code>. This is a case of data migrations.</p>\\n<p>But how do we handle this without putting our hands in the DB?</p>\\n<h2>Automation is the key</h2>\\n<p>We must be able to describe our database and the migrations with code. This will allow us to store them into our VCS and run them on demand and in an autonomous way.</p>\\n<h2>SQL vs NoSQL</h2>\\n<p>As we know, SQL and NoSQL have some core differences but that also doesn't mean that we can omit migrations in any of them. SQL structure is strictly defined and both data and schema changes can be safely done using migrations. NoSQL, on the other hand, may not need that much of a schema change, due to their elasticity in that subject, but will definitely need data migrations.</p>\\n<h2>Database?</h2>\\n<p>Modern apps don't necessarily handle data or talk to a database directly. E.g., in a Microservices environment, applications may rely on other applications to hold their data and communicate with them through a REST API. That's ok because migrations may still need to run. But instead of interacting directly with a database, you have to use the API to make your changes.</p>\\n<h2>Migrations dive with Nodejs</h2>\\n<p>Applications built with Nodejs have no differences from any other stack.</p>\\n<p>After doing a little research, I ended up using <a href=\\\"https://github.com/sequelize/umzug\\\">umzug</a> which provides a nice programmatic API to make your migrations. It's not opinionated at all and it doesn't provide any helper functions to make your actual migrations. It's just a library that will store what migrations have run. Which is actually what I need. If you need a more powerful thing you may want to take a look at <a href=\\\"https://github.com/db-migrate/node-db-migrate\\\">db-migrate</a>, which provides adapters for major databases and it will help you make changes to those in a more intuitive way.</p>\\n<p>Migration systems are providing a few standard things in order to make your migrations. Let's see those using Node.js:</p>\\n<h3>Write a migration</h3>\\n<p>Usually, we want to define two standard methods for a migration script. The function to run when we are migrating and the function when we are rolling back:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token string\\\">'use strict'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">var</span> Promise <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">require</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">'bluebird'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\nmodule<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>exports <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  up<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">new</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\">Promise</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>resolve<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> reject<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token comment\\\" spellcheck=\\\"true\\\">/* Here we write our migration function */</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n\\n  down<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">new</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\">Promise</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>resolve<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> reject<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token comment\\\" spellcheck=\\\"true\\\">/* This runs if we decide to rollback.

For that matter, we should choose our naming strategy wisely before implementation. I have chosen to give them a separate versioning, e.g. 1.0.js, 1.1.js or we could give them the issue ID of our PM that refers to the particular requirement. The choice is yours. Just be consistent.</p>\\n<h3>Keep track of the migrations that have already been executed</h3>\\n<p>At any given moment, we must be able to tell what migrations have been executed and which migration needs to run next if there is one to run.\\nThis allows us to know the state of our database.</p>\\n<p>Umzug can use Sequelize to store the history of the migration into MySQL. <a href=\\\"https://github.com/sequelize/umzug#custom\\\">But with no hassle at all, we can write our own Adaptor to store them wherever we want</a>.</p>\\n<h3>Run a migration or run all migrations</h3>\\n<p>We have to be able to run a specific migration or run all migrations we have written. Those must run in order because usually some of them depend on others.\\nE.g. on a fresh environment we must run all migrations in order to bring the newly created database to its current state, as it currently lies in production.</p>\\n<p>To run all migrations:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code>umzug<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">up</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">then</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">...</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>or to run up to a particular migration:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code>umzug<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">up</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span> to<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'migration-filename'</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">then</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">...</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h3>Rollback a migration</h3>\\n<p>When defining one particular migration we are describing changes that will be applied to the database. Those changes must be reversible and that is why we must also describe the reverse action of that migration.\\nIn case we need to rollback our application back in a previous state that also introduced database changes, those changes must be revert as well in order for the application to continue operating like it used to do.</p>\\n<p>Just like <code>up</code>, but running <code>down</code> instead:\\nTo revert all migrations:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code>umzug<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">down</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">then</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">...</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>or to revert down to a particular migration:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code>umzug<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">down</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span> to<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'migration-filename'</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">then</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">...</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h3>Automating</h3>\\n<p>umzug doesn't come with a CLI out of the box, but it doesn't take much to write one yourself.\\nAfter I wrote mine, it's just a matter of:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-bash\\\"><code>node scripts/migrate\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>to run all migrations in fresh environments.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-bash\\\"><code>node scripts/migrate <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">[</span>up<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">|</span>down<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">]</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>version<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>to go to that particular migration. This will run on every instance of our application at boot time, so if there is a pending migration, it will run it.</p>\\n<h2>In conclusion</h2>\\n<p>Database manipulation should be part of our development process. There could be heavy changes where a developer couldn't handle and a DBA should come, but for rapid changes, migrations will serve us right, especially when we seeking for faster release cycles and keeping track of our Database changes.</p>\\n<p>I am sure that your system handles migration somehow, search it up if you have never thought of it.</p>\\n<p>In case you are already doing migrations, what is your preferred workflow?

It's not our test suite's responsibility to test anything else that itself.</p>\\n<p>Here's a simple function:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> request <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">require</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">'request'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> createToDoItem <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>description<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">new</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\">Promise</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>resolve<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> reject<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">if</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">!</span>description<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">reject</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">new</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\">Error</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">'description is required'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n\\n    request<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">post</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n      url<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'https://todo/items/endpoint'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n      body<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n        description<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> description<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n        completed<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token boolean\\\">false</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>err<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> res<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> body<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n\\n       <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">if</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>err<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n         <span class=\\\"token function\\\">reject</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>err<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n       <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">else</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n         <span class=\\\"token function\\\">resolve</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>body<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n       <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>So the <code>createToDoItem</code> does two things.

At first, we call our function without a parameter so the first condition will be true and an error will be thrown. Then we stub the <code>request</code> object so it will run the callback function with an error. This will trigger the second condition and reject our promise. Inside the <code>catch</code> function, we know that the promise has been rejected. For the end, we stub the callback to return with a null error and a body that will resolve the promise and we test that inside the <code>then</code> function. 100% code coverage.</p>\\n<p>This way we have completely isolated our Unit Under Test and made it blazingly fast to run since we don't make any actual HTTP requests.

I explained the concept of TDD and described my tools of choice for integrating the TDD flow with Node.js. It was great.</p>\\n<p>I didn't got into GUI testing and I saw a major interest on that. So I decided to take a look at the current state of GUI testing. Here are the main tools that I came up with:</p>\\n<h2>Zombie.js</h2>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://zombie.js.org/\\\">Zombie</a> uses <a href=\\\"https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom\\\">jsdom</a> to parse the required HTML and Javascript and then simulate the desired behaviour. I find it a great tool for testing basic functionality in small apps.</p>\\n<p>JSDom will create an in memory representation of the DOM and execute any Javascript dependencies so you can do a real testing scenario. Since it doesn't uses a real browser engine you can't find abnormalities of real world situations. So you can't rely on it for cross browser compatibility.</p>\\n<p>I got very frustrated while trying to test AJAX powered pages. For SPA apps, Zombie wouldn't be an ideal solution.</p>\\n<h2>Casper.js</h2>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://casperjs.org/\\\">Casper</a> on the other hand, is a wrapper around <a href=\\\"http://phantomjs.org/\\\">Phantom.js</a> which utilises a <a href=\\\"https://webkit.org/\\\">Webkit</a> headless browser and will do a full rendering of your web page in order to test it. Since you will have a full representation of your site you can even <a href=\\\"https://github.com/sindresorhus/pageres\\\">take screenshots for easier QA</a>.</p>\\n<p>Casper.js has neat documentation and it's API is really easy to follow and adopt.</p>\\n<h2>Nightwatch.js</h2>\\n<p>Now, on the heavy side, we have <a href=\\\"http://www.seleniumhq.org/\\\">Selenium</a>. Selenium is a set of projects. It started off by auto running browsers and injecting code into them so we can test it. Since then, browsers vendors kept evolving and expose a full set of control over their browsers so Selenium has native support over those, with the <a href=\\\"http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/\\\">Selenium WebDriver</a>.</p>\\n<p>You will have to install all the browsers you need to test locally and then use Selenium to run tests on them. It's pretty basic.</p>\\n<p>Selenium's internals and configuration is a bit overcomplicated and if you don't need it, you don't have to get into it. <a href=\\\"http://nightwatchjs.org/\\\">Nightwatch</a> is a great layer of abstraction on top of Selenium that will do all the heavy work for you.</p>\\n<h1>At the end</h1>\\n<p>I am sure there are tone of other solutions out there. Although, you will have to do a research on your own before starting your GUI testing journey, at then end just pick one and start.</p>\\n<p>Are you using something already?
