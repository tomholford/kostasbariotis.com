Force everyone to <a href=\\\"https://github.com/airbnb/javascript\\\">be in the same page</a>. As in every other social team, so and your team must <a href=\\\"https://github.com/google/styleguide\\\">meet rules</a> and follow them for the common good.</p>\\n<p>Everyone should write the same code.

Now, this is the first and the last time I'm talking about this. If you don't keep your code under some kind of version control, there is nothing much left for you.</p>\\n<p>Version controlling your code means that you keep history of every file change, every line addition and deletion. Jumping from the present to a certain point of past, that you know your code was working will save you tone of hours of frustration and money.</p>\\n<h3>Dev Environments</h3>\\n<p>that simulates the live project.

Most of the times, team will stay in idle state when they don't know what to do. Talks should be clear to everyone and allow them to do work for a given time before new tasks arrive and reassigned. Those tasks should be sorted by criticality - prioritisation should be respected.</p>\\n<h3>Responsibilities</h3>\\n<p>must be clear to everyone. Have you ever been in a situation where the manager asks why something happened and everyone in the team is looking each other? I know, it sucks. But clearly, there weren't no responsibilities. Keeping responsibilities clear means that everyone knows when it's time to stand up and take the response. So, the team can learn and continue.</p>\\n<h3>Document Everything</h3>\\n<p>because no one can guarantee you a job for ever like no manager can guarantee a team that would stay the same for ever. Documenting means that while the faces in team changes, the work can continue. Each new person coming can immediately  get in track and continue the task the someone left unfinished.</p>\\n<h2>Finally</h2>\\n<p>I would say that, when you're joining a team, you can't simply wait everyone to be as you would like to be.
