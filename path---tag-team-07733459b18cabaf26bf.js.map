You can also take advantage of the npm's <a href=\\\"https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/outdated\\\">outdated command</a> that will check every package and report back for outdated packages.</p>\\n<p>Consider also keeping this setting in your <a href=\\\"https://docs.npmjs.com/files/npmrc\\\"><code>.npmrc</code></a> file, to not force every developer to set it explicitly on his/her machine.</p>\\n<h3>shrinkwrap</h3>\\n<p>npm's <a href=\\\"https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/shrinkwrap\\\">shrinkwrap</a> is also a handy way to lock your versions across your team.
