But why you say.</p>\n<p>When I was growing up I had to deal with two things: a) I didn't had the money to do anything I wanted to do and b) I had to do shitty jobs to get that money.</p>\n<p>So I had to find a solution. I was introduced to programming and everyone were talking about how is the job of the future. I fall in love with it since my first key strokes. I made my decision at that moment.</p>\n<p>I had a mentor back then. My cousin. 20 years of experience more than me and he really wanted to stack them all in my head. Once he said to me: \"There are two options in life. You can either be a cow, walking around the same grass land your whole life or you can be a hawk, flying and traveling every day and watching the world from the sky. You got choose.\" That completely messed up my childhood. I had to find a way to be hawk.</p>\n<p>I don't like long term goals. Even for my longest goals I will break them into smaller tasks and commit to those.</p>\n<p>My most long term goal was and still is one. Is the one that I set when I was a kid in order to solve my problems.</p>\n<p>To be a high paid professional in my industry until my thirtieth birthday.</p>\n<p>Let's break that down:</p>\n<p>Professional: I love programming and that is the primary reason I do it for living. If I didn't do it for any reason, I would probably doing it in my free time. I wrote my first lines of code in the age of 10. That was it for me. Right there I discovered what I wanted to do in life.</p>\n<p>High paid: Not just paying the bills. I want to be high paid. Have you ever declined a suggestion for a road trip or even to get out for some drinks, cause you couldn't afford it? Yeah, I know. I don't want this. I want money to not be problem. They're supposed to be the ticket, not the barrier.</p>\n<p>The original goal was until the age of 25. I failed, so I rescheduled it. If I were to predict my next deadline, I would say I won't fail this time. Even if I do, I will just set the next goal and move on. I had enough.</p>",excerpt:"I am Software Engineer being paid two times over the standard Greek wage. But why you say.

This is how I did it.</p>\n<p><a href="http://devastation.tv">devastation.tv</a>, my podcast for developers (for the time in Greek only) is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/kbariotis/devastation-podcast">GitHub Pages</a> with a custom domain that I have purchased from <a href="https://namecheap.com">Namecheap</a>. I wanted to be able to send email campaigns to my subscribers whenever a new episode is out.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailchimp.com">Mailchimp</a> helped me a lot on my first campaigns but I would send those emails using my personal Gmail account, which is both ugly for the subscriber to see and is <a href="http://kb.mailchimp.com/accounts/email-authentication/about-dmarc?_ga=1.191860521.246269979.1477844435">also dangerous</a> cause it may end up in my subscriber\'s Spam folder.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, I knew my subscriber list would take a long time until it go big and I didn\'t want to pay for a paid subscription, e.g. to Gmail for Work (Â£3.30 per user per month). I had to find a cheaper way, and Mailchimp has a great starter package with up to 2,000 subscribers and 12,000 emails per month.</p>\n<p>So here\'s a simple solution that involves having your site hosted on GitHub Pages, using Mailchimp for sending email campaigns and Namecheap as your domain registrar.</p>\n<h2>Receiving emails</h2>\n<p>For receiving emails, Namecheap has this great <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/308/76/how-can-i-set-up-free-email-forwarding-for-my-domain">email forwarding feature</a> that allows you to forward an incoming email to your domain in an external email. So I put my personal Gmail email there and I am able to receive emails.</p>\n<p>\n          <a\n            class="gatsby-resp-image-link"\n            href="undefined"\n            style="display: block"\n            target="_blank"\n            rel="noopener"\n          >\n            <span\n              class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n              style="position: relative; z-index: -1; display: block; "\n            >\n              <span\n                class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n                style="padding-bottom: 22.45989304812834%;position: relative; width: 100%; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAECAYAAACOXx+WAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAAaUlEQVQY032OWQqAMAwFvf8pFdT+CO7NUu0zCIJCbGBISGBeqrbrUdcNRAQ5Z4QQwMz37EFExXsFpyQl6HG4kAVvJo3W3/stRoiqL+R5QpxG0LqClwG8z78Bb5LhCtU+lAeV4scf4XniAsiPOq9tajTMAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n              >\n                <img\n                  class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n                  style="width: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n                  alt="Hello"\n                  title=""\n                  src="/static/ac29928edd2828fa9fbc8c52fda0d42c-cd462.png"\n                  srcset="/static/ac29928edd2828fa9fbc8c52fda0d42c-92f91.png 188w,\n/static/ac29928edd2828fa9fbc8c52fda0d42c-dc30f.png 375w,\n/static/ac29928edd2828fa9fbc8c52fda0d42c-cd462.png 750w,\n/static/ac29928edd2828fa9fbc8c52fda0d42c-4812a.png 1122w"\n                  sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"\n                />\n              </span>\n            </span>\n          </a>\n          </p>\n<h2>Sending emails</h2>\n<p>Now Mailchimp allows you to <a href="http://kb.mailchimp.com/accounts/email-authentication/set-up-custom-domain-authentication-dkim-and-spf">add a custom domain</a> to be able to send emails that originated from that domain.
